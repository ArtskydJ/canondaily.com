	<span class="header">Prayer for the Filling of the Spirit</span>

	<span class="paragraph">Father, your word has promised that if we ask for the Spirit, you will give of the Spirit far more readily than parents give the necessities of life to their children. I lay claim to the “how much more” of Luke 11:13 and ask that you would give to me an extra portion of the Spirit’s presence for today. I need the Spirit because you have commanded me to “walk in the Spirit”<span class="verse"> (Gal. 5:16)</span> in everything that I do. Help me to “sing in the Spirit”<span class="verse"> (1 Cor. 14:15)</span>, to “worship...in the Spirit”<span class="verse"> (Phil. 3:3)</span> and to “rejoice in the Holy Spirit”<span class="verse"> (1 Thes. 1:6; Rom. 14:17)</span>. Please help me to “pray in the Spirit”<span class="verse"> (Jude 20; Eph. 6:18)</span> since I do not know what I should pray for as I ought<span class="verse"> (Rom. 8:26)</span>. Help me to “love in the Spirit”<span class="verse"> (Col. 1:18)</span>, be “led by the Spirit”<span class="verse"> (Matt. 4:1; Rom. 8:14; Gal. 5:18)</span>, be “moved by the Spirit”<span class="verse"> (Luke 2:27)</span>, be “compelled by the Spirit”<span class="verse"> (Acts 20:22 NIV)</span> and to have my “mind controlled by the Spirit”<span class="verse"> (Rom. 8:6)</span>. May every part of me be controlled by the Spirit<span class="verse"> (Rom. 8:6,9)</span> so that I might “live in the Spirit”<span class="verse"> (Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:13)</span>. I want to be taught by the Holy Spirit<span class="verse"> (1 Cor. 2:13)</span>, to speak by the Spirit since “no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit”<span class="verse"> (1 Cor. 12:3)</span>. Wash and sanctify me by the Spirit<span class="verse"> (1 Cor. 6:11)</span>.</span>

	<span class="paragraph">I know that Paul’s prayer in Ephesians 1:17-20 is according to your will, and I ask that the reality of your transforming power would work in my life today:</span>

	<span class="paragraph">... that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places...</span>

	<span class="paragraph">I do not ask this because I deserve it, but because I am united to Christ and He has purchased everything that is necessary for my full enjoyment of the Spirit. I ask it simply because you have promised the Spirit to those who come in faith<span class="verse"> (Gal. 3:1-5; Luke 11:13)</span>. Thank you for your gracious gift, Father. I love you and praise you. May the Spirit cause me to glorify you today.</span>

	<span class="paragraph">Lord Jesus, you are the vine and we are the branches<span class="verse"> (John 15:1-8)</span>. I acknowledge that my life flows from you, and that without you I can do nothing<span class="verse"> (v. 5)</span>. I know that you were given the Holy Spirit “without measure.” I ask that you would release your life into my life that I might bear fruit. Release your strength, wisdom, healing [etc.] to meet the needs of this day. You have said that all who drink of you will never thirst since they will have within them a fountain of living water that never grows dry<span class="verse"> (John 4:14)</span>. I need that for my dryness. I lay claim to your promise in John 7:37-39:</span>

	<span class="paragraph">...If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.” But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span>

	<span class="paragraph">Lord, since you have been glorified, and everything necessary has been done that we might receive the Spirit, I pray that the Holy Spirit would be poured out upon me today. This passage says that “anyone” who thirsts may come to drink and will receive. Lord, I come to you and I now drink of you. Thank you for your gift of the Spirit. Thank you for your life giving waters.</span>

	<span class="paragraph">Holy Spirit, I invite you now to baptize me afresh with the fire of your love. I want to know you, not just know about you. I want to experience your presence in my life. I give myself to you and ask that you would give yourself to me. I need your power in my life. Please come, and fill me now. Come into my life as the “Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD”<span class="verse"> (Isa. 11:2)</span>. I need those things in my life. I am your bondservant and I come humbly to be controlled and moved by you. Whatever giftings you want to pour out in my life today<span class="verse"> (1 Cor.12-14; Eph. 4:7ff; Rom. 12:3-8; 1 Pet. 4:9-11)</span>, I gladly receive and determine now to use to the glory of the Father. I will not limit your gifts by my perceptions of what I can handle, or what I need. I receive your sovereign will to give as you please. Work in me mightily to the glory of God.</span>

	<span class="paragraph">Fill me with your gracious fruit. Help me to walk in the Spirit that I might not fulfill the lusts of the flesh<span class="verse"> (Gal. 5:16)</span>. I lay claim to your supernatural love that can love the unlovable. I lay claim to your joy of the Lord which is my strength<span class="verse"> (Neh. 8:10)</span>. I lay claim to Your peace that passes all understanding<span class="verse"> (Phil. 4:7)</span>; your longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control<span class="verse"> (Gal. 5.23)</span>. Help me to do everything today by your working, that you would replace my evil thinking with the mind of Christ<span class="verse"> (1 Cor. 2.16)</span>, my rebellious will with the will of Christ, my unruly emotions with the compassion of Christ.</span>

	<span class="paragraph">Flow through me to minister to others. Please flood the deepest places of my life, washing away the filth and replacing it with the righteousness of Christ. Cleanse my wounds that still tend to dominate my thoughts and are keeping me from emotional freedom. Help me to know Christ and the power of His resurrection.</span>

	<span class="paragraph">I want to learn more and more what it means to walk in the Spirit. May I not lift so much as a straw from the ground without your presence, love and approval. By faith, I thank you even now that you have answered this prayer and have poured out your Spirit in my life. Praise be to your name! Praise be to your name! I love you and thank you.
