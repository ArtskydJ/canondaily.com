Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> The soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> and the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. So they all escaped safely to the land. </span> </span>

		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Proud</div>
		Proud people wait for the other to come and ask forgiveness when there is a misunderstanding or conflict in a relationship.

		Broken people take the initiative to be reconciled when there is misunderstanding or  conflict in relationships; they race to the cross; they see if they can get there first, no  matter how wrong the other may have been.
