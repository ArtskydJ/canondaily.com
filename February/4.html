But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he didn’t let the people go. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, “Take handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boils and blisters breaking out on man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became boils and blisters breaking on man and on animal.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The magicians couldn’t stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn’t listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, ‘This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, that they may serve me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For now I would have stretched out my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> because you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won’t let them go.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter. The hail will come down on every man and animal that is found in the field, and isn’t brought home, and they will die.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Those who feared Yahweh’s word among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Whoever didn’t respect Yahweh’s word left his servants and his livestock in the field. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man, and on animal, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens, and Yahweh sent thunder and hail; and lightning flashed down to the earth. Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “I have sinned this time. Yahweh is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Pray to Yahweh; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to Yahweh. The thunders shall cease, and there will not be any more hail; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh’s.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> But as for you and your servants, I know that you don’t yet fear Yahweh God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley had ripened and the flax was blooming.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had not grown up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to Yahweh; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didn’t let the children of Israel go, just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs among them;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your son’s son, what things I have done to Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I am Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, “This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won’t be able to see the earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.’ ” He turned, and went out from Pharaoh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve Yahweh, their God. Don’t you yet know that Egypt is destroyed?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve Yahweh your God; but who are those who will go?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Moses said, “We will go with our young and with our old. We will go with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He said to them, “Yahweh be with you if I let you go with your little ones! See, evil is clearly before your faces.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Not so! Go now you who are men, and serve Yahweh; for that is what you desire!” Then they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, nor will there ever be again.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, “I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to Yahweh your God, that he may also take away from me this death.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh sent an exceedingly strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he didn’t let the children of Israel go. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> They didn’t see one another, and nobody rose from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, “Go, serve Yahweh. Only let your flocks and your herds stay behind. Let your little ones also go with you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Moses said, “You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Our livestock also shall go with us. Not a hoof shall be left behind, for of it we must take to serve Yahweh our God; and we don’t know with what we must serve Yahweh, until we come there.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he wouldn’t let them go.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Moses said, “You have spoken well.

His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, “Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But he said to them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Haven’t you read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him; </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> how he entered into God’s house, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Or have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless? </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’</span> <span class="paragraphtext">you wouldn’t have condemned the guiltless. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He departed from there, and went into their synagogue.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> And behold there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?” that they might accuse him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He said to them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won’t he grab on to it, and lift it out? </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then he told the man, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him, how they might destroy him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there.
