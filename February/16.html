Likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second coupling.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling. The loops were opposite to one another.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains to one another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was a unit. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He made curtains of goats’ hair for a covering over the tabernacle. He made them eleven curtains.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the width of each curtain. The eleven curtains had one measure.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the coupling, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain which was outermost in the second coupling.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together, that it might be a unit.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of sea cow hides above. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the width of each board.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Each board had two tenons, joined to one another.

He did this to both of them in the two corners.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> There were eight boards and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets—under every board two sockets. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> He made bars of acacia wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> He made the middle bar to pass through in the middle of the boards from the one end to the other.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> He overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold as places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> He made the veil of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cherubim. He made it the work of a skillful workman.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> He made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were of gold. He cast four sockets of silver for them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> He made a screen for the door of the tent, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> and the five pillars of it with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold, and their five sockets were of bronze. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">37</span><span class="verse">1</span> Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood.
