Likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second coupling.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling. The loops were opposite to one another.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains to one another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was a unit. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He made curtains of goats’ hair for a covering over the tabernacle.

Their hooks were of gold. He cast four sockets of silver for them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> He made a screen for the door of the tent, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> and the five pillars of it with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold, and their five sockets were of bronze. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">37</span><span class="verse">1</span> Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood.
