Behold, if the swelling of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> he is a leprous man.

If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray? </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But if he doesn’t listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the middle of them.”</span> </span>

Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to write.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him.” </span> </span>

		Proud people want to be sure that no one finds out when they have sinned; their instinct is to cover up.

		Broken people, once broken, don’t care who knows or who finds out; they are willing to be  exposed because they have nothing to lose.
