Afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> He shall examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and it appears to be deeper than the wall,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> The priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread in the walls of the house,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> He shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over. They shall pour out the mortar that they scraped off outside of the city into an unclean place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> They shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> “If the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it was plastered,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> then the priest shall come in and look; and behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew in the house. It is unclean.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the house’s mortar.

Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> “Indeed, all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain.

I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme.

It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“He said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which I will reveal to you; </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’</span> </span>
