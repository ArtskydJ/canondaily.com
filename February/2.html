Moses took God’s rod in his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> You shall tell Pharaoh, ‘Yahweh says, Israel is my son, my firstborn,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> and I have said to you, “Let my son go, that he may serve me;” and you have refused to let him go.

Then she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He went, and met him on God’s mountain, and kissed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Moses told Aaron all Yahweh’s words with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had instructed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> The people believed, and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, “This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don’t know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> They said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The king of Egypt said to them, “Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> You shall require from them the number of the bricks which they made before. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, saying, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to our God.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor in it. Don’t let them pay any attention to lying words.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you straw.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The taskmasters were urgent saying, “Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, “Why haven’t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, ‘Make brick!’ and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> But Pharaoh said, “You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to Yahweh.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Go therefore now, and work; for no straw shall be given to you; yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble when it was said, “You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> They met Moses and Aaron, who stood along the way, as they came out from Pharaoh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They said to them, “May Yahweh look at you and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, “Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people. You have not rescued your people at all!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> God spoke to Moses, and said to him, “I am Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore tell the children of Israel, ‘I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> I will take you to myself for a people. I will be your God; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn’t listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, “Behold, the children of Israel haven’t listened to me.

There was a man of Macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, “Come over into Macedonia and help us.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Good News to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> On the Sabbath day we went outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us. The Lord opened her heart to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.” So she persuaded us. </span> </span>
