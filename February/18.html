We are ready to kill him before he comes near.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But Paul’s sister’s son heard they were lying in wait, and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Paul summoned one of the centurions, and said, “Bring this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to tell him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer, and said, “Paul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, “What is it that you have to tell me?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Therefore don’t yield to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse to neither eat nor drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him, “Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He called to himself two of the centurions, and said, “Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> He asked them to provide animals, that they might set Paul on one, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> He wrote a letter like this: </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> “Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> “This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their council.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> I found him to be accused about questions of their law, but not to be charged with anything worthy of death or of imprisonment.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> When I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you. Farewell.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> When the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. When he understood that he was from Cilicia, he said,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> “I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive.” He commanded that he be kept in Herod’s palace. </span> </span>
