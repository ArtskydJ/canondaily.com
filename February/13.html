They said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children and not to walk after the customs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Take them and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Then Paul took the men, and the next day purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.  </span>

	<div class="subheader">Proud VS Broken</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader">Proud</div>
		Proud people have a subconscious feeling, “This ministry/church is privileged to have me and my gifts”; they think of what they can do for God.
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader">Broken</div>
		Broken people’s heart attitude is, “I don’t deserve to have a part in any ministry”; they  know that they have nothing to offer God except the life of Jesus flowing through their  broken lives.
