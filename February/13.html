For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He answered them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’</span> <span class="paragraphtext">and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,” </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> ‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,</span> <span class="line">and honor me with their lips;</span> <span class="line">but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> And in vain do they worship me,</span> <span class="line">teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’ ”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He summoned the multitude, and said to them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Hear, and understand. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Then the disciples came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> But he answered, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Leave them alone.

They said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children and not to walk after the customs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Take them and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Then Paul took the men, and the next day purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.  </span>

	<div class="subheader">Proud vs. Broken</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Proud</div>
		Proud people have a subconscious feeling, “This ministry/church is privileged to have me and my gifts”; they think of what they can do for God.
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Broken</div>
		Broken people’s heart attitude is, “I don’t deserve to have a part in any ministry”; they  know that they have nothing to offer God except the life of Jesus flowing through their  broken lives.
