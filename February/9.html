		<span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">19</span><span class="verse">23</span> About that time there arose no small disturbance concerning the Way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, “Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> You see and hear that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods that are made with hands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> When they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out, saying, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> The whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> When Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples didn’t allow him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them didn’t know why they had come together.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defense to the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, “You men of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn’t know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Seeing then that these things can’t be denied, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rash.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges against one another.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning today’s riot, there being no cause. Concerning it, we wouldn’t be able to give an account of this commotion.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> When he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly. </span> </span>
