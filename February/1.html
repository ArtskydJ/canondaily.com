		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> All the souls who came out of Jacob’s body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn’t know Joseph.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He said to his people, “Behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Come, let’s deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies and fight against us, and escape out of the land.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They started to dread the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> and they made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> and he said, “When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool, if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> But the midwives feared God,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and didn’t do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, “Why have you done this thing and saved the boys alive?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women aren’t like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Because the midwives feared God, he gave them families.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The woman conceived and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her servant to get it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The young woman went and called the child’s mother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The woman took the child, and nursed it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and said, “Because I drew him out of the water.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Moses was afraid, and said, “Surely this thing is known.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, “How is it that you have returned so early today?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> She bore a son, and he named him Gershom,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> for he said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> In the course of those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> God saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God’s mountain, to Horeb.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh’s</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> angel appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Moses said, “I will go now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> When Yahweh saw that he came over to see, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, “Moses! Moses!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Here I am.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He said, “Don’t come close. Take off your sandals, for the place you are standing on is holy ground.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Moreover he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He said, “Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Moses said to God, “Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what should I tell them?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM,” and he said, “You shall tell the children of Israel this: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> God said moreover to Moses, “You shall tell the children of Israel this, ‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, ‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, “I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> They will listen to your voice. You shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> I know that the king of Egypt won’t give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do among them, and after that he will let you go.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing. You shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians.” </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">22</span> Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> They wrote these things by their hand: </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: greetings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, ‘You must be circumcised and keep the law,’ to whom we gave no commandment;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you. Farewell.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> So, when they were sent off, they came to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> When they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> After they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Barnabas planned to take John, who was called Mark, with them also.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> But Paul didn’t think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia, and didn’t go with them to do the work.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> Then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> but Paul chose Silas and went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies. </span> </span>
