The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “ ‘If it is an animal of which men offer an offering to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He shall not alter it, nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. If he shall at all exchange animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to Yahweh, then he shall set the animal before the priest;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> and the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest evaluates it, so it shall be.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> “ ‘When a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest evaluates it, so it shall stand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “ ‘If a man dedicates to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it. The sowing of a homer </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of silver.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall remain his.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to Yahweh, as a devoted field. It shall be owned by the priests. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> “ ‘If he dedicates a field to Yahweh which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee; and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> to the shekel.</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> “ ‘However the firstborn among animals, which belongs to Yahweh as a firstborn, no man may dedicate, whether an ox or a sheep. It is Yahweh’s.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it; or if it isn’t redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> “ ‘Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man devotes to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed. Everything that is permanently devoted is most holy to Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> “ ‘No one devoted to destruction, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> “ ‘All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is Yahweh’s. It is holy to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> He shall not examine whether it is good or bad, neither shall he exchange it. If he exchanges it at all, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> These are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai. </span> </span>

When they had come together, he said to them, “I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They said to him, “We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> But we desire to hear from you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying about God’s Kingdom, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> When they didn’t agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> saying, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">‘Go to this people and say, </span> <span class="line">in hearing, you will hear, </span> <span class="line">but will in no way understand. </span> <span class="line">In seeing, you will see, </span> <span class="line">but will in no way perceive. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">27</span> For this people’s heart has grown callous. </span> <span class="line">Their ears are dull of hearing. </span> <span class="line">Their eyes they have closed. </span> <span class="line">Lest they should see with their eyes, </span> <span class="line">hear with their ears, </span> <span class="line">understand with their heart, </span> <span class="line">and would turn again, </span> <span class="line">then I would heal them.’</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> “Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the nations, and they will listen.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house and received all who were coming to him,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> preaching God’s Kingdom, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance. </span> </span>
