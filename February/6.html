It is mine.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Moses said to the people, “Remember this day, in which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Today you go out in the month Abib.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> It shall be, when Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you. No yeast shall be seen with you, within all your borders.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> You shall tell your son in that day, saying, ‘It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came out of Egypt.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that Yahweh’s law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “It shall be, when Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and will give it you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb, and every firstborn that comes from an animal which you have. The males shall be Yahweh’s.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> It shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ that you shall tell him, ‘By strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of livestock. Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> When Pharaoh had let the people go, God didn’t lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt”;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the children of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn’t depart from before the people. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by the sea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, ‘They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has shut them in.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh.” They did so. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The king of Egypt was told that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He prepared his chariot, and took his army with him;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, with captains over all of them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The Egyptians pursued them. All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> When Pharaoh came near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel cried out to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> They said to Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us out of Egypt?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Isn’t this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?’ For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will work for you today; for you will never again see the Egyptians whom you have seen today.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh will fight for you, and you shall be still.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Why do you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. Then the children of Israel shall go into the middle of the sea on dry ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Behold, I myself will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will go in after them. I will get myself honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. There was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night. One didn’t come near the other all night. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the middle of the sea: all of Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> In the morning watch, Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, “Let’s flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh’s army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh; and they believed in Yahweh and in his servant Moses. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh, and said, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously. </span> <span class="line">He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> Yah is my strength and song. </span> <span class="line">He has become my salvation. </span> <span class="line">This is my God, and I will praise him; </span> <span class="line">my father’s God, and I will exalt him. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh is a man of war. </span> <span class="line">Yahweh is his name. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> He has cast Pharaoh’s chariots and his army into the sea. </span> <span class="line">His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> The deeps cover them. </span> <span class="line">They went down into the depths like a stone. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. </span> <span class="line">Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you. </span> <span class="line">You send out your wrath. It consumes them as stubble. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up. </span> <span class="line">The floods stood upright as a heap. </span> <span class="line">The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> The enemy said, ‘I will pursue.

My hand will destroy them.’ </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> You blew with your wind. </span> <span class="line">The sea covered them. </span> <span class="line">They sank like lead in the mighty waters. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods? </span> <span class="line">Who is like you, glorious in holiness, </span> <span class="line">fearful in praises, doing wonders? </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> You stretched out your right hand. </span> <span class="line">The earth swallowed them. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">13</span> “You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed. </span> <span class="line">You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> The peoples have heard. </span> <span class="line">They tremble. </span> <span class="line">Pangs have taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">15</span> Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. </span> <span class="line">Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. </span> <span class="line">All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">16</span> Terror and dread falls on them. </span> <span class="line">By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone, </span> <span class="line">until your people pass over, Yahweh, </span> <span class="line">until the people you have purchased pass over. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">17</span> You will bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, </span> <span class="line">the place, Yahweh, which you have made for yourself to dwell in; </span> <span class="line">the sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have established. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">18</span> Yahweh will reign forever and ever.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Miriam answered them, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously. </span> <span class="line">The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> When they came to Marah, they couldn’t drink from the waters of Marah, for they were bitter.

I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He departed there, and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Don’t be afraid, but speak and don’t be silent; </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> saying, “This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don’t want to be a judge of these matters.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> So he drove them from the judgment seat. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat.
