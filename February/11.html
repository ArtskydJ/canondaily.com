He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> For Herod had arrested John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For John said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> She, being prompted by her mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady; and she brought it to her mother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their sick.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But Jesus said to them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Bring them here to me.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children. </span> </span>
