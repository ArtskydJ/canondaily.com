Who are we, that you murmur against us?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Moses said, “Now Yahweh will give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you, because Yahweh hears your murmurings which you murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Moses said to Aaron, “Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘Come close to Yahweh, for he has heard your murmurings.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> As Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, Yahweh’s glory appeared in the cloud.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> “I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, ‘At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> In the evening, quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they didn’t know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded: ‘Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The children of Israel did so, and some gathered more, some less.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They each gathered according to his eating.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Moses said to them, “Let no one leave of it until the morning.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Notwithstanding they didn’t listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, so it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He said to them, “This is that which Yahweh has spoken, ‘Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> They laid it up until the morning, as Moses ordered, and it didn’t become foul, and there were no worms in it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it in the field.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> On the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Behold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> So the people rested on the seventh day. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> The house of Israel called its name “Manna”,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, ‘Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Moses said to Aaron, “Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your generations.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Now an omer is one tenth of an ephah.</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, starting according to Yahweh’s commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The people were thirsty for water there; so the people murmured against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.” Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He called the name of the place Massah,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and Meribah,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh, saying, “Is Yahweh among us, or not?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God’s rod in my hand.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. When he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But Moses’ hands were heavy; so they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Moses built an altar, and called its name “Yahweh our Banner”.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He said, “Yah has sworn: ‘Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">18</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> for Moses said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land”.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The name of the other was Eliezer,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> for he said, “My father’s God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with Moses’ sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your wife, and her two sons with her.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Jethro said, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of the way that they treated people arrogantly.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> On the next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, “What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men which fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard cases to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land. </span> </span>
