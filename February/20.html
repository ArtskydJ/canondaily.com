He put the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He set the turban on his head. He set the golden plate, the holy crown, on the front of the turban, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He sprinkled it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the basin and its base, to sanctify them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, and tied sashes on them, and put headbands on them, as Yahweh commanded Moses. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He killed it; and Moses took the blood, and put it around on the horns of the altar with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He took all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it on the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> But the bull, and its skin, and its meat, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He presented the ram of the burnt offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burned the head, and the pieces, and the fat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> He washed the innards and the legs with water; and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> He presented the other ram, the ram of consecration. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He killed it; and Moses took some of its blood, and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> He brought Aaron’s sons; and Moses put some of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that was on the innards, the cover of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before Yahweh, he took one unleavened cake, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat and on the right thigh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> He put all these in Aaron’s hands and in his sons’ hands, and waved them for a wave offering before Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Moses took them from their hands, and burned them on the altar on the burnt offering. They were a consecration offering for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before Yahweh. It was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Moses took some of the anointing oil, and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> What remains of the meat and of the bread you shall burn with fire.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your consecration are fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> What has been done today, so Yahweh has commanded to do, to make atonement for you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> You shall stay at the door of the Tent of Meeting day and night seven days, and keep Yahweh’s command, that you don’t die: for so I am commanded.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh commanded by Moses. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> and he said to Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without defect, and offer them before Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without defect, for a burnt offering;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today Yahweh appears to you.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting. All the congregation came near and stood before Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do; and Yahweh’s glory shall appear to you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Yahweh commanded.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> So Aaron came near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The meat and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head. He burned them upon the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people. Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh for a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Fire came out from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before Yahweh, which he had not commanded them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Fire came out from before Yahweh, and devoured them, and they died before Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what Yahweh spoke of, saying, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">‘I will show myself holy to those who come near me, </span> <span class="line">and before all the people I will be glorified.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Aaron held his peace.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Draw near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> So they came near, and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Don’t let the hair of your heads go loose, and don’t tear your clothes, so that you don’t die, and so that he will not be angry with all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh has kindled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you.” They did according to the word of Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then Yahweh said to Aaron,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink whenever you go into the Tent of Meeting, or you will die. This shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You are to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> You are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh has spoken to them by Moses.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, “Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons’ portion, of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire; for so I am commanded.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your portion, and your sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The heaved thigh and the waved breast they shall bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before Yahweh. It shall be yours, and your sons’ with you, as a portion forever, as Yahweh has commanded.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and, behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> it was burned. He was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> “Why haven’t you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is most holy, and he has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Aaron spoke to Moses, “Behold, today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh; and such things as these have happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in Yahweh’s sight?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his sight. </span> </span>
