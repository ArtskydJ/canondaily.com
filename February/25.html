		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">27</span><span class="verse">13</span> When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is called Euroclydon. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When the ship was caught and couldn’t face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> After they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> On the third day, they threw out the ship’s tackle with their own hands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the middle of them, and said, “Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete and have gotten this injury and loss.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> saying, ‘Don’t be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore, sirs, cheer up!
