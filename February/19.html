		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that prosperity is coming to this nation by your foresight,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> But that I don’t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, “Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> seeing that you can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> In the temple they didn’t find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> In this I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, ‘Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, “When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, “Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often and talked with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds. </span> </span>

		Proud people are concerned with being respectable, with what others think; they work to protect their own image and reputation.

		Broken people are concerned with being real; what matters to them is not what others  think but what God knows; they are willing to die to their own reputation.
