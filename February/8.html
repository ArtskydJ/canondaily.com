Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He said to the people, “Be ready by the third day. Don’t have sexual relations with a woman.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> All of Mount Sinai smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Let the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break out on them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Moses said to Yahweh, “The people can’t come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Yahweh said to him, “Go down! You shall bring Aaron up with you, but don’t let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest he break out against them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> So Moses went down to the people, and told them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> God</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> spoke all these words, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> “You shall have no other gods before me. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> “You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “You shall not misuse the name of Yahweh your God,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who misuses his name. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> You shall labor six days, and do all your work,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God. You shall not do any work in it, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> “You shall not murder. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> “You shall not commit adultery. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “You shall not steal. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> All the people perceived the thunderings, the lightnings, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> They said to Moses, “Speak with us yourself, and we will listen; but don’t let God speak with us, lest we die.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that his fear may be before you, that you won’t sin.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The people stayed at a distance, and Moses came near to the thick darkness where God was. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “This is what you shall tell the children of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> You shall most certainly not make gods of silver or gods of gold for yourselves to be alongside me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of cut stones; for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> You shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.’ </span> </span>

Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted their price, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Now after these things had ended, Paul determined in the Spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.  </span>
