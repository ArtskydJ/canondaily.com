According to all that Yahweh commanded him, so he did. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> In the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was raised up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Moses raised up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised up its pillars.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tabernacle above on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He took and put the covenant into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the covenant, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> He put the table in the Tent of Meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside of the veil.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He set the bread in order on it before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> He put the lamp stand in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> He lit the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> He put the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting before the veil;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> and he burned incense of sweet spices on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> He put up the screen of the door to the tabernacle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> He set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water therein, with which to wash.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> When they went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> He raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and Yahweh’s glory filled the tabernacle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> Moses wasn’t able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh’s glory filled the tabernacle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> When the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> but if the cloud wasn’t taken up, then they didn’t travel until the day that it was taken up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys. </span> </span>

Or what will a man give in exchange for his life? </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.” </span> </span>

Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Those who stood by said, “Do you malign God’s high priest?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Paul said, “I didn’t know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’ ”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, “Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> When he had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the crowd was divided.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees’ part stood up, and contended, saying, “We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let’s not fight against God!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The following night, the Lord stood by him and said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Cheer up, Paul, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at Rome.”</span> </span>
