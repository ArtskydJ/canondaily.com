It is an everlasting covenant on the behalf of the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> It shall be for Aaron and his sons.

According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> According to the length of the years you shall increase its price, and according to the shortness of the years you shall diminish its price; for he is selling the number of the crops to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am Yahweh your God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> “ ‘Therefore you shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> If you said, “What shall we eat the seventh year?

It shall not be released in the Jubilee.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> But the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be accounted for with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> “ ‘Nevertheless, in the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem the houses in the cities of their possession at any time.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> The Levites may redeem the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, and it shall be released in the Jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> But the field of the pasture lands of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> “ ‘If your brother has become poor, and his hand can’t support himself among you, then you shall uphold him.

One of his brothers may redeem him;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">49</span> or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">50</span> He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale shall be according to the number of years; he shall be with him according to the time of a hired servant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">51</span> If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">52</span> If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">53</span> As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him. He shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">54</span> If he isn’t redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee: he and his children with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">55</span> For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt.

Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said to him, “We are able.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He said to them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> But Jesus summoned them, and said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> It shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you shall be</span> <span class="paragraphtext">your servant. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> They told him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him. </span> </span>

Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came and were cured.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was “The Twin Brothers.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> where we found brothers,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and were entreated to stay with them for seven days. So we came to Rome.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him. </span> </span>
