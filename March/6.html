		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you will be saved from your enemies. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am Yahweh your God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the covenant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The children of Israel went forward on their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> They first went forward according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> First, the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies. Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, went forward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The standard of the camp of Reuben went forward according to their armies. Elizur the son of Shedeur was over his army.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai was over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary. The others set up the tabernacle before they arrived. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies. Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set forward according to their armies. Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies; and they went forward. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are journeying to the place of which Yahweh said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well; for Yahweh has spoken good concerning Israel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> He said to him, “I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Moses said, “Don’t leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> It shall be, if you go with us—yes, it shall be—that whatever good Yahweh does to us, we will do the same to you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days’ journey. The ark of Yahweh’s covenant went before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> The cloud of Yahweh was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> When the ark went forward, Moses said, “Rise up, Yahweh, and let your enemies be scattered! Let those who hate you flee before you!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> When it rested, he said, “Return, Yahweh, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> The people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh. When Yahweh heard it, his anger burned; and Yahweh’s fire burned among them, and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The name of that place was called Taberah,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> because Yahweh’s fire burned among them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly; and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, “Who will give us meat to eat?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The manna was like coriander seed, and it looked like bdellium.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and Yahweh’s anger burned greatly; and Moses was displeased.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why haven’t I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Where could I get meat to give all these people? For they weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favor in your sight; and don’t let me see my wretchedness.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you don’t bear it yourself alone. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> “Say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, and you will eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt.” Therefore Yahweh will give you meat, and you will eat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> You will not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, “Why did we come out of Egypt?” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Moses said, “The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Has Yahweh’s hand grown short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Moses went out, and told the people Yahweh’s words; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the Spirit rested on them. They were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, “My lord Moses, forbid them!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all Yahweh’s people were prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> A wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> above the surface of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> The people rose up all that day, and all of that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers; </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and they spread them all out for themselves around the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, Yahweh’s anger burned against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> because there they buried the people who lusted. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">22</span><span class="verse">23</span> On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up offspring</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> for his brother.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> After them all, the woman died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> But Jesus answered them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God’s angels in heaven. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?’</span> <span class="paragraphtext">God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Jesus said to him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> This is the first and great commandment. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> A second likewise is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.” </span> </span>

For there is no distinction,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> whom God sent to be an atoning sacrifice,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God’s forbearance;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Or is God the God of Jews only? Isn’t he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! No, we establish the law. </span> </span>
