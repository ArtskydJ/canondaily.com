		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> They said, “Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses? Hasn’t he spoken also with us?” And Yahweh heard it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all the men who were on the surface of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, “You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The three of them came out.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He said, “Now hear my words. If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh, will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> With him, I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see Yahweh’s form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh’s anger burned against them; and he departed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, please don’t count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “Heal her, God, I beg you!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, shouldn’t she be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people didn’t travel until Miriam was brought in again.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Send men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel. Of every tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, every one a prince among them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Yahweh. All of them were men who were heads of the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> These were their names: </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">13</span> Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">15</span> Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">16</span> These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">17</span> Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country.  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">18</span> See the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">19</span> and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">20</span> and what the land is, whether it is fertile or poor, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> They went and came to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to all the congregation. They showed them the fruit of the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> They told him, and said, “We came to the land where you sent us. Surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Amalek dwells in the land of the South. The Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, “Let’s go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> But the men who went up with him said, “We aren’t able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> There we saw the Nephilim,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> We were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, “We wish that we had died in the land of Egypt, or that we had died in this wilderness!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be captured or killed! Wouldn’t it be better for us to return into Egypt?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> They said to one another, “Let’s choose a leader, and let’s return into Egypt.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us: a land which flows with milk and honey.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Only don’t rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us. Their defense is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us. Don’t fear them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Yahweh’s glory appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have worked among them?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Moses said to Yahweh, “Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from among them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you Yahweh are among this people; for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Now please let the power of the Lord</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> be great, according as you have spoken, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> ‘Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness, and just as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh said, “I have pardoned according to your word;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> but in very deed—as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with Yahweh’s glory—  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him I will bring into the land into which he went. His offspring shall possess it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Since the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley, tomorrow turn and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation that complain against me? I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel, which they complain against me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Tell them, ‘As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so I will do to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were counted of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have complained against me,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> surely you shall not come into the land concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> But I will bring your little ones that you said should be captured or killed in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies are consumed in the wilderness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know my alienation.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> I, Yahweh, have spoken. I will surely do this to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> The men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> They rose up early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, “Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised; for we have sinned.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> Moses said, “Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh, since it shall not prosper?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> Don’t go up, for Yahweh isn’t among you; that way you won’t be struck down before your enemies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you will fall by the sword because you turned back from following Yahweh; therefore Yahweh will not be with you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain. Nevertheless, the ark of Yahweh’s covenant and Moses didn’t depart out of the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down, even to Hormah. </span> </span>
