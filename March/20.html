Therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you; that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> “You shall not murder. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> “You shall not commit adultery. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> “You shall not steal. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.

For this great fire will consume us.

They have well said all that they have spoken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Oh that there were such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them and with their children forever! </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> “Go tell them, ‘Return to your tents.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> But as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you. You shall not turn away to the right hand or to the left.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you, that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land that you go over to possess;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you—you, your son, and your son’s son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it, that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God.

Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as we are today.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all these commandments before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.” </span> </span>
