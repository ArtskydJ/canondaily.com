He shall not give more, lest if he should give more and beat him more than that many stripes, then your brother will be degraded in your sight. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies and has no son, the wife of the dead shall not be married outside to a stranger. Her husband’s brother shall go in to her, and take her as his wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> It shall be that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name not be blotted out of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> If the man doesn’t want to take his brother’s wife, then his brother’s wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to raise up to his brother a name in Israel. He will not perform the duty of a husband’s brother to me.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him. If he stands and says, “I don’t want to take her,”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> then his brother’s wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his sandal from off his foot, and spit in his face. She shall answer and say, “So shall it be done to the man who does not build up his brother’s house.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> His name shall be called in Israel, “The house of him who had his sandal removed.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When men strive against each other, and the wife of one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him, and puts out her hand, and grabs him by his private parts,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> then you shall cut off her hand. Your eye shall have no pity. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> You shall not have in your bag diverse weights, one heavy and one light.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> You shall not have in your house diverse measures, one large and one small.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> You shall have a perfect and just weight.

You shall put it in a basket, and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> You shall come to the priest who shall be in those days, and tell him, “I profess today to Yahweh your God, that I have come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers to give us.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it down before Yahweh your God’s altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> You shall answer and say before Yahweh your God, “My father</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> was a Syrian ready to perish.

There he became a great, mighty, and populous nation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The Egyptians mistreated us, afflicted us, and imposed hard labor on us.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Then we cried to Yahweh, the God of our fathers. Yahweh heard our voice, and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, with great terror, with signs, and with wonders;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which you, Yahweh, have given me.” You shall set it down before Yahweh your God, and worship before Yahweh your God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> You shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite, and the foreigner who is among you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> When you have finished tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within your gates and be filled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> You shall say before Yahweh your God, “I have put away the holy things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandment which you have commanded me. I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have I forgotten them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor given of it for the dead.
