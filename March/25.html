Yahweh is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> This shall be the priests’ due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest: the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the inner parts.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> You shall give him the first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand to minister in Yahweh’s name, him and his sons forever. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel where he lives, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God, as all his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They shall have like portions to eat, in addition to that which comes from the sale of his family possessions. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When you have come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not learn to imitate the abominations of those nations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who tells fortunes, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> or a charmer, or someone who consults with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> For whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh. Because of these abominations, Yahweh your God drives them out from before you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> You shall be blameless with Yahweh your God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> For these nations that you shall dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery and to diviners; but as for you, Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from among you, of your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> This is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, “Let me not hear again Yahweh my God’s voice, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh said to me, “They have well said that which they have spoken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you. I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> You may say in your heart, “How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> When a prophet speaks in Yahweh’s name, if the thing doesn’t follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">19</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Yahweh your God cuts off the nations whose land Yahweh your God gives you, and you succeed them and dwell in their cities and in their houses,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the middle of your land, which Yahweh your God gives you to possess.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> You shall prepare the way, and divide the borders of your land which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit into three parts, that every man slayer may flee there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> This is the case of the man slayer who shall flee there and live: Whoever kills his neighbor unintentionally, and didn’t hate him in time past—  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood and his hand swings the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle and hits his neighbor so that he dies—he shall flee to one of these cities and live.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the man slayer while hot anger is in his heart and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally, even though he was not worthy of death, because he didn’t hate him in time past.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore I command you to set apart three cities for yourselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> If Yahweh your God enlarges your border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> and if you keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you today, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk ever in his ways, then you shall add three cities more for yourselves, in addition to these three.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> This is so that innocent blood will not be shed in the middle of your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, leaving blood guilt on you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> But if any man hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises up against him, strikes him mortally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the innocent blood from Israel that it may go well with you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> You shall not remove your neighbor’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin that he sins. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> and the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother. So you shall remove the evil from among you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and will never again commit any such evil among you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more numerous than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and shall tell them, “Hear, Israel, you draw near today to battle against your enemies. Don’t let your heart faint! Don’t be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The officers shall speak to the people, saying, “What man is there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> What man is there who has pledged to be married to a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, “What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest his brother’s heart melt as his heart.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> It shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> It shall be, if it gives you answer of peace and opens to you, then it shall be that all the people who are found therein shall become forced laborers to you, and shall serve you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> but the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its plunder, you shall take for plunder for yourself. You may use the plunder of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But of the cities of these peoples that Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as Yahweh your God has commanded you;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> that they not teach you to follow all their abominations, which they have done for their gods; so would you sin against Yahweh your God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; for you may eat of them. You shall not cut them down, for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged by you?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Only the trees that you know are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down. You shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">1</span> If someone is found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess, lying in the field, and it isn’t known who has struck him,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> It shall be that the elders of the city which is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer of the herd, which hasn’t been worked with and which has not drawn in the yoke.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The priests the sons of Levi shall come near, for them Yahweh your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in Yahweh’s name; and according to their word shall every controversy and every assault be decided.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> All the elders of that city which is nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> They shall answer and say, “Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Forgive, Yahweh, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and don’t allow innocent blood among your people Israel.” The blood shall be forgiven them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> So you shall put away the innocent blood from among you, when you shall do that which is right in Yahweh’s eyes. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> When you go out to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God delivers them into your hands and you carry them away captive,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you are attracted to her, and desire to take her as your wife,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> then you shall bring her home to your house. She shall shave her head and trim her nails.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> She shall take off the clothing of her captivity, and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month. After that you shall go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she desires; but you shall not sell her at all for money. You shall not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> If a man has two wives, the one beloved and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated, and if the firstborn son is hers who was hated,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not give the son of the beloved the rights of the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength. The right of the firstborn is his. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not listen to them,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city and to the gate of his place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> They shall tell the elders of his city, “This our son is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey our voice. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall remove the evil from among you. All Israel shall hear, and fear. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God. Don’t defile your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance. </span> </span>
