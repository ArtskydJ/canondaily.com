So you shall do with his garment. So you shall do with every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost and you have found. You may not hide yourself.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> You shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them. You shall surely help him to lift them up again. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> A woman shall not wear men’s clothing, neither shall a man put on women’s clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> If you come across a bird’s nest on the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> You shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take for yourself, that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> When you build a new house, then you shall make a railing around your roof, so that you don’t bring blood on your house if anyone falls from there. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest all the fruit be defiled, the seed which you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> You shall not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> You shall make yourselves fringes</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> on the four corners of your cloak with which you cover yourself. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, hates her,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> accuses her of shameful things, gives her a bad name, and says, “I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I didn’t find in her the tokens of virginity;”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> then the young lady’s father and mother shall take and bring the tokens of the young lady’s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The young lady’s father shall tell the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man as his wife, and he hates her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Behold, he has accused her of shameful things, saying, ‘I didn’t find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;’ and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity.” They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> They shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has given a bad name to a virgin of Israel.

So you shall remove the evil from among you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> But if the man finds the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> but to the lady you shall do nothing. There is in the lady no sin worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was no one to save her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> If a man finds a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, grabs her and lies with her, and they are found,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady’s father fifty shekels</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of silver.

He shall not come within the camp;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> but it shall be, when evening comes, he shall bathe himself in water. When the sun is down, he shall come within the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> You shall have a place also outside of the camp where you go relieve yourself.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> You shall have a trowel among your weapons. It shall be, when you relieve yourself, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your excrement;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> for Yahweh your God walks in the middle of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you. Therefore your camp shall be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> You shall not deliver to his master a servant who has escaped from his master to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He shall dwell with you, among you, in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best. You shall not oppress him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages of a male prostitute,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow; for both of these are an abomination to Yahweh your God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> You shall not lend on interest to your brother: interest of money, interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> You may charge a foreigner interest; but you shall not your brother interest, that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you go in to possess it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When you vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack to pay it, for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> But if you refrain from making a vow, it shall be no sin in you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> You shall observe and do that which has gone out of your lips. Whatever you have vowed to Yahweh your God as a free will offering, which you have promised with your mouth, you must do.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, then you may eat your fill of grapes at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your container.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not use a sickle on your neighbor’s standing grain. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> When a man takes a wife and marries her, then it shall be, if she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a certificate of divorce, put it in her hand, and send her out of his house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> When she has departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> If the latter husband hates her, and write her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the latter husband dies, who took her to be his wife;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife after she is defiled; for that would be an abomination to Yahweh. You shall not cause the land to sin, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out in the army, neither shall he be assigned any business.

It shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is one of your brothers or one of the foreigners who are in your land within your gates.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> In his day you shall give him his wages, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor and sets his heart on it; lest he cry against you to Yahweh, and it be sin to you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers.

Therefore I command you to do this thing. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it. It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow, that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again. It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When you harvest your vineyard, you shall not glean it after yourselves. It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt. Therefore I command you to do this thing. </span> </span>

		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Proud</div>
		Proud people wait for the other to come and ask forgiveness when there is a misunderstanding or conflict in a relationship.
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Broken</div>
		Broken people take the initiative to be reconciled when there is misunderstanding or  conflict in relationships; they race to the cross; they see if they can get there first, no  matter how wrong the other may have been.
