Go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers—to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob—to give to them and to their offspring</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> after them.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> I spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the sky for multitude.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, as he has promised you!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> How can I myself alone bear your problems, your burdens, and your strife?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Take wise men of understanding who are respected among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and respected men, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> I commanded your judges at that time, saying, “Hear cases between your brothers and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> We traveled from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as Yahweh the God of your fathers has spoken to you. Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> You came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let’s send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The thing pleased me well. I took twelve of your men, one man for every tribe.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Then I said to you, “Don’t be terrified. Don’t be afraid of them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Yahweh your God, who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> and in the wilderness where you have seen how that Yahweh your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Yet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh your God,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Yahweh heard the voice of your words and was angry, and swore, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> “Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that he has trodden on to him and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> Moreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there. I will give it to them, and they shall possess it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against Yahweh. We will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> Yahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I am not among you, lest you be struck before your enemies.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you and chased you as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn’t listen to your voice, nor turn his ear to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">46</span> So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh spoke to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> “You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Command the people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be careful.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Don’t contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years, Yahweh your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> So we passed by from our brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh said to me, “Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you any of his land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> (The Emim lived there before, a great and numerous people, and tall as the Anakim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> These also are considered to be Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The Horites also lived in Seir in the past, but the children of Esau succeeded them. They destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place, as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.) </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> “Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook Zered. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we had come over the brook Zered were thirty-eight years: until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Moreover Yahweh’s hand was against them, to destroy them from the middle of the camp, until they were consumed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> So, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh spoke to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> “You are to pass over Ar, the border of Moab, today.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> When you come near the border of the children of Ammon, don’t bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> (That also is considered a land of Rephaim. Rephaim lived there in the past, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> a great people, many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them from before Israel, and they succeeded them, and lived in their place;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> as he did for the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Then the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.) </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> “Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Today I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> “Let me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway. I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink. Just let me pass through on my feet,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as it is today. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. We left no one remaining.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> Only the livestock we took for plunder for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities which we had taken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. Yahweh our God delivered up all before us.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn’t come near: all the banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us. </span> </span>
