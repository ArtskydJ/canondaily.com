You shall cut down the engraved images of their gods. You shall destroy their name out of that place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> You shall not do so to Yahweh your God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> But to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, you shall seek his habitation, and you shall come there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> You shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, your vows, your free will offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> There you shall eat before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, in which Yahweh your God has blessed you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> You shall not do all the things that we do here today, every man whatever is right in his own eyes;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> for you haven’t yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which Yahweh your God gives you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> But when you go over the Jordan and dwell in the land which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that you dwell in safety,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God—you, and your sons, your daughters, your male servants, your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Be careful that you don’t offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> but in the place which Yahweh chooses in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yet you may kill and eat meat within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to Yahweh your God’s blessing which he has given you. The unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and the deer.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Only you shall not eat the blood. You shall pour it out on the earth like water.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your free will offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> but you shall eat them before Yahweh your God in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose: you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates. You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God in all that you put your hand to.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Be careful that you don’t forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> When Yahweh your God enlarges your border, as he has promised you, and you say, “I want to eat meat,” because your soul desires to eat meat, you may eat meat, after all the desire of your soul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> If the place which Yahweh your God shall choose to put his name is too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates, after all the desire of your soul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Even as the gazelle and as the deer is eaten, so you shall eat of it. The unclean and the clean may eat of it alike.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Only be sure that you don’t eat the blood; for the blood is the life. You shall not eat the life with the meat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> You shall not eat it. You shall pour it out on the earth like water.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> You shall not eat it, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, when you do that which is right in Yahweh’s eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> You shall offer your burnt offerings, the meat and the blood, on Yahweh your God’s altar. The blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on Yahweh your God’s altar, and you shall eat the meat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in Yahweh your God’s eyes. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> When Yahweh your God cuts off the nations from before you where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> be careful that you are not ensnared to follow them after they are destroyed from before you, and that you not inquire after their gods, saying, “How do these nations serve their gods? I will do likewise.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> You shall not do so to Yahweh your God; for every abomination to Yahweh, which he hates, they have done to their gods; for they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Whatever thing I command you, that you shall observe to do. You shall not add to it, nor take away from it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you, and he gives you a sign or a wonder,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, “Let’s go after other gods” (which you have not known) “and let’s serve them,”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams; for Yahweh your God is testing you, to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> You shall walk after Yahweh your God, fear him, keep his commandments, and obey his voice. You shall serve him, and cling to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk in. So you shall remove the evil from among you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, entices you secretly, saying, “Let’s go and serve other gods”—which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth—  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> you shall not consent to him nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> but you shall surely kill him. Your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hands of all the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more wickedness like this among you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> If you hear about one of your cities, which Yahweh your God gives you to dwell there, that  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> certain wicked fellows have gone out from among you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, “Let’s go and serve other gods,” which you have not known,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> then you shall inquire, investigate, and ask diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination was done among you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, with all that is therein and its livestock, with the edge of the sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> You shall gather all its plunder into the middle of its street, and shall burn with fire the city, with all of its plunder, to Yahweh your God. It shall be a heap forever. It shall not be built again.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand, that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger and show you mercy, and have compassion on you and multiply you, as he has sworn to your fathers,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> when you listen to Yahweh your God’s voice, to keep all his commandments which I command you today, to do that which is right in Yahweh your God’s eyes. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> You are the children of Yahweh your God.

Because they chew the cud but don’t part the hoof, they are unclean to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn’t chew the cud, is unclean to you. You shall not eat their meat.
