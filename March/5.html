He lit its lamps to light the area in front of the lamp stand, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> This was the workmanship of the lamp stand, beaten work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work. He made the lamp stand according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> “Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> You shall do this to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then let them take a young bull and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting. You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You shall present the Levites before Yahweh. The children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> “The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> You shall set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting. You shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all the children of Israel, I have taken them to me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, so that there will be no plague among the children of Israel when the children of Israel come near to the sanctuary.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel did to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> After that, the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron and before his sons: as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> “This is what is assigned to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the Tent of Meeting;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> and from the age of fifty years they shall retire from doing the work, and shall serve no more,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> but shall assist their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the duty, and shall perform no service. This is how you shall have the Levites do their duties.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep it in its appointed season. You shall keep it according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Those men said to him, “We are unclean because of the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among the children of Israel?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Moses answered them, “Wait, that I may hear what Yahweh will command concerning you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “Say to the children of Israel, ‘If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people. Because he didn’t offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> “ ‘If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Passover to Yahweh, then he shall do so according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance. You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him who is born in the land.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the Tent of the Testimony. At evening it was over the tabernacle, as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> So it was continually. The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel traveled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> At the commandment of Yahweh, the children of Israel traveled, and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept Yahweh’s command, and didn’t travel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled; or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children of Israel remained encamped, and didn’t travel; but when it was taken up, they traveled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> At the commandment of Yahweh they encamped, and at the commandment of Yahweh they traveled. They kept Yahweh’s command, at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses. </span> </span>

Because first of all, they were entrusted with the revelations of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar.

Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> May it never be! For then how will God judge the world?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), “Let’s do evil, that good may come?” Those who say so are justly condemned. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way.
