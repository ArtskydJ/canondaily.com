Amen. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel that are of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Neither, because they are Abraham’s offspring, are they all children. But, “your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as heirs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> For this is a word of promise, “At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Not only so, but Rebekah also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> it was said to her, “The elder will serve the younger.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Even as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For he said to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires. </span> </span>
