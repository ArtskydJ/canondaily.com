		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">29</span><span class="verse">1</span> These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Moses called to all Israel, and said to them: </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> But Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not grown old on you, and your sandals have not grown old on your feet.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us to battle, and we struck them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> We took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> All of you stand today in the presence of Yahweh your God: your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> your little ones, your wives, and the foreigners who are in the middle of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God, and into his oath, which Yahweh your God makes with you today,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> that he may establish you today as his people, and that he may be your God, as he spoke to you and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Neither do I make this covenant and this oath with you only,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> but with those who stand here with us today before Yahweh our God, and also with those who are not here with us today  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the middle of the nations through which you passed;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> and you have seen their abominations and their idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which were among them);  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> lest there should be among you man, woman, family, or tribe whose heart turns away today from Yahweh our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that produces bitter poison;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, “I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,” to destroy the moist with the dry.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh will not pardon him, but then Yahweh’s anger and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book will fall on him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh will set him apart for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The generation to come—your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who will come from a far land—will say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span>  that all of its land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, doesn’t produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Even all the nations will say, “Why has Yahweh done this to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Then men will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> and went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods that they didn’t know and that he had not given to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against this land, to bring on it all the curses that are written in this book.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and thrust them into another land, as it is today.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">30</span><span class="verse">1</span> It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations where Yahweh your God has driven you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> and return to Yahweh your God and obey his voice according to all that I command you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> that then Yahweh your God will release you from captivity, have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the peoples where Yahweh your God has scattered you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there Yahweh your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you will possess it. He will do you good, and increase your numbers more than your fathers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your offspring, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> You shall return and obey Yahweh’s voice, and do all his commandments which I command you today.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh your God will make you prosperous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good; for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> if you will obey Yahweh your God’s voice, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For this commandment which I command you today is not too hard for you or too distant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up for us to heaven, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will go over the sea for us, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But the word is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and evil.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> For I command you today to love Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you go in to possess it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away and worship other gods, and serve them,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> I declare to you today that you will surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your descendants,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days, that you may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">31</span><span class="verse">1</span> Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He said to them, “I am one hundred twenty years old today. I can no more go out and come in. Yahweh has said to me, ‘You shall not go over this Jordan.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh your God himself will go over before you. He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua will go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when he destroyed them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or scared of them; for Yahweh your God himself is who goes with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh himself is who goes before you. He will be with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be discouraged.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, and to all the elders of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of booths,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and the foreigners who are within your gates, that they may hear, learn, fear Yahweh your God, and observe to do all the words of this law,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> and that their children, who have not known, may hear and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, your days approach that you must die. Call Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the Tent’s door.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers. This people will rise up and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land where they go to be among them, and will forsake me and break my covenant which I have made with them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Haven’t these evils come on us because our God is not among us?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> “Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> For when I have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat, then they will turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> It will happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song will testify before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out of the mouths of their descendants; for I know their ways and what they are doing today, before I have brought them into the land which I promised them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them. I will be with you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> “Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of Yahweh your God’s covenant, that it may be there for a witness against you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet alive with you today, you have been rebellious against Yahweh. How much more after my death?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn away from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days, because you will do that which is evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished. </span> </span>

Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">59</span> Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">60</span> and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone against the door of the tomb, and departed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">61</span> Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">62</span> Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">63</span> saying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">64</span> Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">65</span> Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">66</span> So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone. </span> </span>
