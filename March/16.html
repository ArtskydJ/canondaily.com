idols, destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">53</span> You shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for I have given the land to you to possess it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">54</span> You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance.

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">18</span> For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hope  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> But if we hope for that which we don’t see, we wait for it with patience. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don’t know how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can’t be uttered.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit’s mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Whom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified. Whom he justified, those he also glorified. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> He who didn’t spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Who could bring a charge against God’s chosen ones? It is God who justifies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Even as it is written, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“For your sake we are killed all day long. </span> <span class="line">We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.”</span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">37</span> No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">38</span> For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">39</span> nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from God’s love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. </span> </span>
