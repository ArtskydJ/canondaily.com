But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might produce fruit to God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law worked in our members to bring out fruit to death.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> What shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be! However, I wouldn’t have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn’t have known coveting, unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The commandment which was for life, this I found to be for death;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good. </span> </span>

	<div class="subheader">Proud vs. Broken</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Proud</div>
		Proud people have a subconscious feeling, “This ministry/church is privileged to have me and my gifts”; they think of what they can do for God.
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Broken</div>
		Broken people’s heart attitude is, “I don’t deserve to have a part in any ministry”; they  know that they have nothing to offer God except the life of Jesus flowing through their  broken lives.
