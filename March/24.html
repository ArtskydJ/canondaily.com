		<span class="header">Deuteronomy 15-17</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">1</span> At the end of every seven years, you shall cancel debts.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> This is the way it shall be done: every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor. He shall not require payment from his neighbor and his brother, because Yahweh’s release has been proclaimed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Of a foreigner you may require it; but whatever of yours is with your brother, your hand shall release.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> However there will be no poor with you (for Yahweh will surely bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess)  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> if only you diligently listen to Yahweh your God’s voice, to observe to do all this commandment which I command you today.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For Yahweh your God will bless you, as he promised you. You will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow. You will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> If a poor man, one of your brothers, is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need, which he lacks.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Beware that there not be a wicked thought in your heart, saying, “The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand,” and your eye be evil against your poor brother and you give him nothing; and he cry to Yahweh against you, and it be sin to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You shall surely give, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him, because it is for this thing Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you put your hand to.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For the poor will never cease out of the land. Therefore I command you to surely open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and serves you six years, then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your wine press. As Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you. Therefore I command you this thing today.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> It shall be, if he tells you, “I will not go out from you,” because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall do likewise.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> It shall not seem hard to you when you let him go free from you; for he has been double the value of a hired hand as he served you six years. Yahweh your God will bless you in all that you do.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> You shall dedicate all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock to Yahweh your God. You shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> You shall eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place which Yahweh shall choose, you and your household.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> If it has any defect—is lame or blind, or has any defect whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> You shall eat it within your gates. The unclean and the clean shall eat it alike, as the gazelle and as the deer.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Only you shall not eat its blood. You shall pour it out on the ground like water. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God; for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you out of Egypt by night.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> You shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Yahweh shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> You shall eat no leavened bread with it. You shall eat unleavened bread with it seven days, even the bread of affliction (for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste) that you may remember the day when you came out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> No yeast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither shall any of the meat, which you sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came out of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God chooses. In the morning you shall return to your tents.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Six days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God. You shall do no work.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> You shall count for yourselves seven weeks. From the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to count seven weeks.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a free will offering of your hand, which you shall give according to how Yahweh your God blesses you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God: you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite who is within your gates, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow who are among you, in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt. You shall observe and do these statutes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> You shall keep the feast of booths seven days, after you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your wine press.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> You shall rejoice in your feast, you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow who are within your gates.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> You shall keep a feast to Yahweh your God seven days in the place which Yahweh chooses, because Yahweh your God will bless you in all your increase and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be altogether joyful.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Three times in a year all of your males shall appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he chooses: in the feast of unleavened bread, in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of booths. They shall not appear before Yahweh empty.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Every man shall give as he is able, according to Yahweh your God’s blessing which he has given you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> You shall make judges and officers in all your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality. You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> You shall follow that which is altogether just, that you may live and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> You shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside Yahweh your God’s altar, which you shall make for yourselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Neither shall you set yourself up a sacred stone which Yahweh your God hates. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> You shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox or a sheep in which is a defect or anything evil; for that is an abomination to Yahweh your God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> If there is found among you, within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you, a man or woman who does that which is evil in Yahweh your God’s sight in transgressing his covenant,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the stars of the sky, which I have not commanded,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> and you are told, and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in Israel,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> then you shall bring out that man or that woman who has done this evil thing to your gates, even that same man or woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death. At the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The hands of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall remove the evil from among you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> If there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh your God chooses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> You shall come to the priests who are Levites and to the judge who shall be in those days. You shall inquire, and they shall give you the verdict.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You shall do according to the decisions of the verdict which they shall give you from that place which Yahweh chooses. You shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> According to the decisions of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do. You shall not turn away from the sentence which they announce to you, to the right hand, nor to the left.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The man who does presumptuously in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die. You shall put away the evil from Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> All the people shall hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When you have come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and possess it and dwell in it, and say, “I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me,”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> you shall surely set him whom Yahweh your God chooses as king over yourselves. You shall set as king over you one from among your brothers. You may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; because Yahweh has said to you, “You shall not go back that way again.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He shall not multiply wives to himself, that his heart not turn away. He shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write himself a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the Levitical priests.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> It shall be with him, and he shall read from it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not turn away from the commandment to the right hand, or to the left, to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the middle of Israel. </span> </span>
