There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> When the season for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and seize his inheritance.’ </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> So they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> They told him, “He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> Jesus said to them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Did you never read in the Scriptures, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">‘The stone which the builders rejected</span> <span class="line">was made the head of the corner.</span> <span class="line">This was from the Lord.</span> <span class="line">It is marvelous in our eyes?’</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> “Therefore I tell you, God’s Kingdom will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing its fruit. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">46</span> When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet. </span> </span>
