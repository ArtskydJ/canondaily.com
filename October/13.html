		<span class="header">Jeremiah 28-29</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">28</span><span class="verse">1</span> That same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in Yahweh’s house, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Within two full years I will bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon,’ says Yahweh; ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in Yahweh’s house,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> even the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May Yahweh do so. May Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Yahweh’s house, and all those who are captives, from Babylon to this place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Nevertheless listen now to this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, of evil, and of pestilence.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet happens, then the prophet will be known, that Yahweh has truly sent him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Yahweh says: ‘Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.’ ” Then the prophet Jeremiah went his way. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> “Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “You have broken the bars of wood, but you have made in their place bars of iron.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they will serve him. I have also given him the animals of the field.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah! Yahweh has not sent you, but you make this people trust in a lie.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth. This year you will die, because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">29</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> (after Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem),  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon). It said: </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the captives whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> “Build houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Take wives and father sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there, and don’t be diminished.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to Yahweh for it; for in its peace you will have peace.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Don’t let your prophets who are among you and your diviners deceive you. Don’t listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> For they prophesy falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them,” says Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For Yahweh says, “After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,” says Yahweh, “thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope and a future.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> You shall seek me, and find me, when you search for me with all your heart.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> I will be found by you,” says Yahweh, “and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Yahweh. I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Because you have said, “Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon;”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh says concerning the king who sits on David’s throne, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who haven’t gone with you into captivity;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh of Armies says: “Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like rotten figs that can’t be eaten, they are so bad.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> because they have not listened to my words,” says Yahweh, “with which I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not hear,” says Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Hear therefore Yahweh’s word, all you captives, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name: “Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he will kill them before your eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> A curse will be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, ‘Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> because they have done foolish things in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I didn’t command them. I am he who knows, and am witness,” says Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> “Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in Yahweh’s house, for every man who is crazy, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long. Build houses, and dwell in them. Plant gardens, and eat their fruit?” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> “Send to all of the captives, saying, ‘Yahweh says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I didn’t send him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie;”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> therefore Yahweh says, “Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his offspring. He will not have a man to dwell among this people. He won’t see the good that I will do to my people,” says Yahweh, “because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh.” ’ ” </span> </span>

A man’s wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> I say, “Keep the king’s command!” because of the oath to God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Don’t be hasty to go out of his presence.

	<div class="subheader">Proud vs. Broken</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Proud</div>
		Proud people have a subconscious feeling, “This ministry/church is privileged to have me and my gifts”; they think of what they can do for God.
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Broken</div>
		Broken people’s heart attitude is, “I don’t deserve to have a part in any ministry”; they  know that they have nothing to offer God except the life of Jesus flowing through their  broken lives.
