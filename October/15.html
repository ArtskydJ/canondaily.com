		<span class="header">Jeremiah 32</span>
		
		<span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">32</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem. Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Why do you prophesy, and say, ‘Yahweh says, “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will take it;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> and Zedekiah king of Judah won’t escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes will see his eyes;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> and he will bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit him,” says Yahweh: “though you fight with the Chaldeans, you will not prosper?” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Jeremiah said, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> ‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying, “Buy my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “So Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to Yahweh’s word, and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours. Buy it for yourself.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“Then I knew that this was Yahweh’s word.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of silver.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> I signed the deed, sealed it, called witnesses, and weighed the money in the balances to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> “I commanded Baruch before them, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last many days.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Houses and fields and vineyards will yet again be bought in this land.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh, saying, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">17</span> “Ah Lord Yahweh! Behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for you.  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">18</span> You show loving kindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them. The great, the mighty God, Yahweh of Armies is your name:  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">19</span> great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings;  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">20</span> who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among other men; and made yourself a name, as it is today;  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">21</span> and brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, with wonders, with a strong hand, with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">22</span> and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">23</span> They came in and possessed it, but they didn’t obey your voice and didn’t walk in your law. They have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do. Therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> “Behold, siege ramps have come to the city to take it. The city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, of the famine, and of the pestilence. What you have spoken has happened. Behold, you see it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> You have said to me, Lord Yahweh, ‘Buy the field for money, and call witnesses;’ whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> “Behold, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for me?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Therefore Yahweh says: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will take it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> The Chaldeans, who fight against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> “For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day, so that I should remove it from before my face,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger: they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> They have turned their backs to me, and not their faces. Although I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech, which I didn’t command them. It didn’t even come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Now therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning this city, about which you say, “It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> “Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place. I will cause them to dwell safely.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their good, and the good of their children after them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good. I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> For Yahweh says: “Just as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> Fields will be bought in this land, about which you say, ‘It is desolate, without man or animal. It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> Men will buy fields for money, sign the deeds, seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed,” says Yahweh. </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hatred, man doesn’t know it; all is before them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean, to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn’t sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner; he who takes an oath, as he who fears an oath.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yes also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For to him who is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For the living know that they will die, but the dead don’t know anything, neither do they have any more a reward; for their memory is forgotten.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Also their love, their hatred, and their envy has perished long ago; neither do they any longer have a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Go your way—eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Let your garments be always white, and don’t let your head lack oil.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your life of vanity, which he has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity, for that is your portion in life, and in your labor in which you labor under the sun.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor plan, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> where you are going. </span> </span>

There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">47</span> When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">48</span> Jesus therefore said to him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">49</span> The nobleman said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">50</span> Jesus said to him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Go your way. Your son lives.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">51</span> As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying “Your child lives!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">52</span> So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> the fever left him.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">53</span> So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Your son lives.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> He believed, as did his whole house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">54</span> This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee. </span> </span>
