		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Proud</div>
		Proud people wait for the other to come and ask forgiveness when there is a misunderstanding or conflict in a relationship.

		Broken people take the initiative to be reconciled when there is misunderstanding or  conflict in relationships; they race to the cross; they see if they can get there first, no  matter how wrong the other may have been.
