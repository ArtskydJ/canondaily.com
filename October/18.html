		<span class="header">Jeremiah 37-38</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">37</span><span class="verse">1</span> Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, listened to Yahweh’s words, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Pray now to Yahweh our God for us.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Pharaoh’s army had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke up from Jerusalem. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘You shall tell the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help you, will return to Egypt into their own land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The Chaldeans will come again, and fight against this city. They will take it and burn it with fire.” ’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “Yahweh says, ‘Don’t deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely depart from us;” for they will not depart.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and only wounded men remained among them, they would each rise up in his tent and burn this city with fire.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When the army of the Chaldeans had broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the middle of the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When he was in Benjamin’s gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Then Jeremiah said, “That is false! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">But he didn’t listen to him; so Irijah seized Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> then Zedekiah the king sent, and had him brought out. The king asked him secretly in his house, “Is there any word from Yahweh?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Jeremiah said, “There is.” He also said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you, nor against this land?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard. They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">38</span><span class="verse">1</span> Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Yahweh says, ‘He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live, and he will escape with his life, and he will live.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh says, ‘This city will surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will take it.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then the princes said to the king, “Please let this man be put to death; because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man doesn’t seek the welfare of this people, but harm.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Zedekiah the king said, “Behold, he is in your hand; for the king can’t do anything to oppose you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then they took Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard. They let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in Benjamin’s gate),  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. He is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Jeremiah did so.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet to himself into the third entry that is in Yahweh’s house. Then the king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? If I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you will go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul will live, and this city will not be burned with fire. You will live, along with your house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But if you will not go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you won’t escape out of their hand.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> But Jeremiah said, “They won’t deliver you. Obey, I beg you, Yahweh’s voice, in that which I speak to you; so it will be well with you, and your soul will live.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> ‘Behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house will be brought out to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women will say, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Your familiar friends have turned on you, </span> <span class="line">and have prevailed over you. </span> <span class="line">Your feet are sunk in the mire, </span> <span class="line">they have turned away from you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> They will bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans. You won’t escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. You will cause this city to be burned with fire.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know of these words, and you won’t die.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don’t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also tell us what the king said to you;’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> then you shall tell them, ‘I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Then all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken. </span> </span>
