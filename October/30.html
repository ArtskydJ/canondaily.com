		<span class="line"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> I am the man who has seen affliction </span> <span class="line">by the rod of his wrath. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, </span> <span class="line">and not in light. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> Surely he turns his hand against me </span> <span class="line">again and again all day long. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> He has made my flesh and my skin old. </span> <span class="line">He has broken my bones. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> He has built against me, </span> <span class="line">and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> He has made me dwell in dark places, </span> <span class="line">as those who have been long dead. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out. </span> <span class="line">He has made my chain heavy. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> Yes, when I cry, and call for help, </span> <span class="line">he shuts out my prayer. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> He has walled up my ways with cut stone. </span> <span class="line">He has made my paths crooked. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> He is to me as a bear lying in wait, </span> <span class="line">as a lion in secret places. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> He has turned away my ways, </span> <span class="line">and pulled me in pieces. </span> <span class="line">He has made me desolate. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> He has bent his bow, </span> <span class="line">and set me as a mark for the arrow. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">13</span> He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> I have become a derision to all my people, </span> <span class="line">and their song all day long. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">15</span> He has filled me with bitterness. </span> <span class="line">He has stuffed me with wormwood. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">16</span> He has also broken my teeth with gravel. </span> <span class="line">He has covered me with ashes. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">17</span> You have removed my soul far away from peace. </span> <span class="line">I forgot prosperity. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">18</span> I said, “My strength has perished, </span> <span class="line">along with my expectation from Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">19</span> Remember my affliction and my misery, </span> <span class="line">the wormwood and the bitterness. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">20</span> My soul still remembers them, </span> <span class="line">and is bowed down within me. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">21</span> This I recall to my mind; </span> <span class="line">therefore I have hope. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">22</span> It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, </span> <span class="line">because his compassion doesn’t fail. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">23</span> They are new every morning. </span> <span class="line">Great is your faithfulness. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">24</span> “Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul. </span> <span class="line">“Therefore I will hope in him.” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">25</span> Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, </span> <span class="line">to the soul who seeks him. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">26</span> It is good that a man should hope </span> <span class="line">and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">27</span> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">28</span> Let him sit alone and keep silence, </span> <span class="line">because he has laid it on him. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">29</span> Let him put his mouth in the dust, </span> <span class="line">if it is so that there may be hope. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">30</span> Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him. </span> <span class="line">Let him be filled full of reproach. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">31</span> For the Lord will not cast off forever. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">32</span> For though he causes grief, </span> <span class="line">yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">33</span> For he does not afflict willingly, </span> <span class="line">nor grieve the children of men. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">34</span> To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth, </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">35</span> to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High, </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">36</span> to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">37</span> Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, </span> <span class="line">when the Lord doesn’t command it? </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">38</span> Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High? </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">39</span> Why does a living man complain, </span> <span class="line">a man for the punishment of his sins? </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">40</span> Let us search and try our ways, </span> <span class="line">and turn again to Yahweh. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">41</span> Let’s lift up our heart with our hands to God</span> <span class="line"> in the heavens. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">42</span> “We have transgressed and have rebelled. </span> <span class="line">You have not pardoned. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">43</span> “You have covered us with anger and pursued us. </span> <span class="line">You have killed. </span> <span class="line">You have not pitied. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">44</span> You have covered yourself with a cloud, </span> <span class="line">so that no prayer can pass through. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">45</span> You have made us an off-scouring and refuse </span> <span class="line">in the middle of the peoples. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">46</span> “All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">47</span> Terror and the pit have come on us, </span> <span class="line">devastation and destruction.” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">48</span> My eye runs down with streams of water, </span> <span class="line">for the destruction of the daughter of my people. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">49</span> My eye pours down </span> <span class="line">and doesn’t cease, </span> <span class="line">without any intermission, </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">50</span> until Yahweh looks down, </span> <span class="line">and sees from heaven. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">51</span> My eye affects my soul, </span> <span class="line">because of all the daughters of my city. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">52</span> They have chased me relentlessly like a bird, </span> <span class="line">those who are my enemies without cause. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">53</span> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, </span> <span class="line">and have cast a stone on me. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">54</span> Waters flowed over my head. </span> <span class="line">I said, “I am cut off.” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">55</span> I called on your name, Yahweh, </span> <span class="line">out of the lowest dungeon. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">56</span> You heard my voice: </span> <span class="line">“Don’t hide your ear from my sighing, </span> <span class="line">and my cry.” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">57</span> You came near in the day that I called on you. </span> <span class="line">You said, “Don’t be afraid.” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">58</span> Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul. </span> <span class="line">You have redeemed my life. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">59</span> Yahweh, you have seen my wrong. </span> <span class="line">Judge my cause. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">60</span> You have seen all their vengeance </span> <span class="line">and all their plans against me. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">61</span> You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, </span> <span class="line">and all their plans against me, </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">62</span> the lips of those that rose up against me, </span> <span class="line">and their plots against me all day long. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">63</span> You see their sitting down and their rising up. </span> <span class="line">I am their song. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">64</span> You will pay them back, Yahweh, </span> <span class="line">according to the work of their hands. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">65</span> You will give them hardness of heart, </span> <span class="line">your curse to them. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">66</span> You will pursue them in anger, </span> <span class="line">and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh. </span>
