		<span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">10</span> So I saw the wicked buried. Indeed they came also from holiness. They went and were forgotten in the city where they did this. This also is vanity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times, and lives long, yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow, because he doesn’t fear God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked. Again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth (even though eyes see no sleep day or night),  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> then I saw all the work of God, that man can’t find out the work that is done under the sun, because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he won’t find it. Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it, he won’t be able to find it. </span> </span>
