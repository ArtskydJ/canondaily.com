		<span class="header">Jeremiah 39-40</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">39</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> All the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s sons in Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the residue of the people who remained.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> “Take him, and take care of him. Do him no harm; but do to him even as he tells you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, with Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home. So he lived among the people. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Now Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they will be accomplished before you in that day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> But I will deliver you in that day,” says Yahweh; “and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> For I will surely save you, and you won’t fall by the sword, but you will escape with your life; because you have put your trust in me,” says Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">40</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, “Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke. Because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come on you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don’t. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right to you to go, there go.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Now while he had not yet gone back, “Go back then,” he said, “to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men came to Gedaliah to Mizpah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us; but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, “Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it. Why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Ishmael.” </span> </span>

		Broken people are concerned with being real; what matters to them is not what others  think but what God knows; they are willing to die to their own reputation.
