Yahweh our God has not sent you to say, ‘You shall not go into Egypt to live there;’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> but Baruch the son of Neriah has turned you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice, to dwell in the land of Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Judah;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice: and they came to Tahpanhes. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brick work, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> and tell them, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his royal pavilion over them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He will come, and will strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death will be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt. He will burn them, and carry them away captive. He will array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he will go out from there in peace.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He will also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and he will burn the houses of the gods of Egypt with fire.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">44</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt, who lived at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah. Behold, today they are a desolation, and no man dwells in them,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other gods that they didn’t know, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, “Oh, don’t do this abominable thing that I hate.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> But they didn’t listen and didn’t incline their ear. They didn’t turn from their wickedness, to stop burning incense to other gods.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is today.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “Therefore now Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Why do you commit great evil against your own souls, to cut off from yourselves man and woman, infant and nursing child out of the middle of Judah, to leave yourselves no one remaining;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have gone to live; that you may be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to live there, and they will all be consumed. They will fall in the land of Egypt. They will be consumed by the sword and by the famine. They will die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine. They will be an object of horror, an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> so that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, will escape or be left to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there; for no one will return except those who will escape.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “As for the word that you have spoken to us in Yahweh’s name, we will not listen to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> But we will certainly perform every word that has gone out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of the sky, and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> “When we burned incense to the queen of the sky, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people who had given him an answer, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> “The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, didn’t Yahweh remember them, and didn’t it come into his mind?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Thus Yahweh could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is today.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed Yahweh’s voice, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is today.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear Yahweh’s word, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, “We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“ ‘Establish then your vows, and perform your vows.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> “Therefore hear Yahweh’s word, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: ‘Behold, I have sworn by my great name,’ says Yahweh, ‘that my name will no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord Yahweh lives.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until they are all gone.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah few in number. All the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, will know whose word will stand, mine or theirs. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> “ ‘This will be the sign to you,’ says Yahweh, ‘that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that my words will surely stand against you for evil.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought his life.’ ” </span> </span>
