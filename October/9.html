Everyone return from his evil way now, and amend your ways and your doings.” ’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But they say, ‘It is in vain; for we will walk after our own plans, and we will each follow the stubbornness of his evil heart.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore Yahweh says: </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Ask now among the nations, </span> <span class="line">‘Who has heard such things?’ </span> <span class="line">The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> Will the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? </span> <span class="line">Will the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up? </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">15</span> For my people have forgotten me. </span> <span class="line">They have burned incense to false gods. </span> <span class="line">They have been made to stumble in their ways, </span> <span class="line">in the ancient paths, </span> <span class="line">to walk in byways, in a way not built up, </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">16</span> to make their land an astonishment, </span> <span class="line">and a perpetual hissing. </span> <span class="line">Everyone who passes by it will be astonished, </span> <span class="line">and shake his head. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">17</span> I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy. </span> <span class="line">I will show them the back, and not the face, </span> <span class="line">in the day of their calamity. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then they said, “Come! Let’s devise plans against Jeremiah; for the law won’t perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet.

I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters. They will each eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies, and those who seek their life, will distress them.” ’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “Then you shall break the container in the sight of the men who go with you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> and shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “Even so I will break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that can’t be made whole again. They will bury in Topheth, until there is no place to bury.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> This is what I will do to this place,” says Yahweh, “and to its inhabitants, even making this city as Topheth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, will be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of Yahweh’s house, and said to all the people:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in Yahweh’s house, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> On the next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes will see it. I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them captive to Babylon, and will kill them with the sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all its precious things, yes, I will give all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies. They will make them captives, take them, and carry them to Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house will go into captivity.
