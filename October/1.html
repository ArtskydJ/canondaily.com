It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> All things are full of weariness beyond uttering.

It is a heavy burden that God</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly.
