He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow let’s go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Whereas you don’t know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn’t do it, to him it is sin. </span> </span>
