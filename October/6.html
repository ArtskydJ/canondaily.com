Even one thing happens to them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they have all one breath; and man has no advantage over the animals; for all is vanity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> All go to one place. All are from the dust, and all turn to dust again.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, whether it goes downward to the earth?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Therefore I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who can bring him to see what will be after him? </span> </span>
