There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. “For whom then, do I labor and deprive my soul of enjoyment?” This also is vanity. Yes, it is a miserable business. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn’t have another to lift him up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn’t know how to receive admonition any more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> For out of prison he came out to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was—yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him.
