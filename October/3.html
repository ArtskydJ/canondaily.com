		<span class="header">Jeremiah 5-6</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Run back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in its wide places, if you can find a man, if there is anyone who does justly, who seeks truth, then I will pardon her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Though they say, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ surely they swear falsely.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> O Yahweh, don’t your eyes look on truth? You have stricken them, but they were not grieved. You have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction. They have made their faces harder than a rock. They have refused to return. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then I said, “Surely these are poor. They are foolish; for they don’t know the Yahweh’s way, nor the law of their God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I will go to the great men and will speak to them, for they know the way of Yahweh, and the law of their God.” But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore a lion out of the forest will kill them. A wolf of the evenings will destroy them. A leopard will watch against their cities. Everyone who goes out there will be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many and their backsliding has increased. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me, and sworn by what are no gods. When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the prostitutes’ houses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They were as fed horses roaming at large. Everyone neighed after his neighbor’s wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Shouldn’t I punish them for these things?” says Yahweh. “Shouldn’t my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “Go up on her walls, and destroy; but don’t make a full end. Take away her branches, for they are not Yahweh’s.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me,” says Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They have denied Yahweh, and said, “It is not he. Evil will won’t come on us. We won’t see sword or famine.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The prophets will become wind, and the word is not in them. Thus it will be done to them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies says, “Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it will devour them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far away, house of Israel,” says Yahweh. “It is a mighty nation. It is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you don’t know and don’t understand what they say.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Their quiver is an open tomb. They are all mighty men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> They will eat up your harvest and your bread, which your sons and your daughters should eat. They will eat up your flocks and your herds. They will eat up your vines and your fig trees. They will beat down your fortified cities in which you trust with the sword. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> “But even in those days,” says Yahweh, “I will not make a full end of you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> It will happen when you say, ‘Why has Yahweh our God done all these things to us?’ Then you shall say to them, ‘Just as you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, so you will serve strangers in a land that is not yours.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> “Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> ‘Hear this now, foolish people without understanding, who have eyes, and don’t see, who have ears, and don’t hear:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Don’t you fear me?’ says Yahweh ‘Won’t you tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it can’t pass it? Though its waves toss themselves, yet they can’t prevail. Though they roar, they still can’t pass over it.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> “But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart. They have revolted and gone.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> They don’t say in their heart, ‘Let’s now fear Yahweh our God, who gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season, who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> “Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> For wicked men are found among my people. They watch, as fowlers lie in wait. They set a trap. They catch men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit. Therefore they have become great, and grew rich.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> They have grown fat. They shine; yes, they excel in deeds of wickedness. They don’t plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and they don’t defend the rights of the needy. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> “Shouldn’t I punish for these things?” says Yahweh. “Shouldn’t my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> “An astonishing and horrible thing has happened in the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority; and my people love to have it so. What will you do in the end of it? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the middle of Jerusalem! Blow the trumpet in Tekoa and raise up a signal on Beth Haccherem, for evil looks out from the north with a great destruction.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> I will cut off the beautiful and delicate one, the daughter of Zion.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Shepherds with their flocks will come to her. They will pitch their tents against her all around. They will feed everyone in his place.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> “Prepare war against her! Arise! Let’s go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Arise! Let’s go up by night, and let’s destroy her palaces.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For Yahweh of Armies said, “Cut down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem. This is the city to be visited. She is wholly oppression within herself.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> As a well produces its waters, so she produces her wickedness. Violence and destruction is heard in her. Sickness and wounds are continually before me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you, lest I make you a desolation, an uninhabited land.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh of Armies says, “They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine. Turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> To whom should I speak and testify, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can’t listen. Behold, Yahweh’s word has become a reproach to them. They have no delight in it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore I am full of Yahweh’s wrath. I am weary with holding it in. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Pour it out on the children in the street, </span> <span class="line">and on the assembly of young men together; </span> <span class="line">for even the husband with the wife will be taken, </span> <span class="line">the aged with him who is full of days. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> Their houses will be turned to others, </span> <span class="line">their fields and their wives together; </span> <span class="line">for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh.” </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">13</span> “For from their least even to their greatest, everyone is given to covetousness. </span> <span class="line">From the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> They have healed also the hurt of my people superficially, </span> <span class="line">saying, ‘Peace, peace!’ when there is no peace. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">15</span> Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? </span> <span class="line">No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush. </span> <span class="line">Therefore they will fall among those who fall. </span> <span class="line">When I visit them, they will be cast down,” says Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh says, “Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, ‘Where is the good way?’ and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> I set watchmen over you, saying, ‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’ But they said, ‘We will not listen!’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is among them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Hear, earth! Behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> To what purpose does frankincense from Sheba come to me, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices are not pleasing to me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Therefore Yahweh says, “Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people. The fathers and the sons together will stumble against them. The neighbor and his friend will perish.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Yahweh says, “Behold, a people comes from the north country. A great nation will be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> They take hold of bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Zion.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> We have heard its report. Our hands become feeble. Anguish has taken hold of us, and pains as of a woman in labor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Don’t go out into the field or walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and terror are on every side.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Daughter of my people, clothe yourself with sackcloth, and wallow in ashes! Mourn, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation, for the destroyer will suddenly come on us. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> “I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress among my people, that you may know and try their way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> They are all grievous rebels, going around to slander. They are bronze and iron. All of them deal corruptly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> The bellows blow fiercely. The lead is consumed in the fire. In vain they go on refining, for the wicked are not plucked away.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Men will call them rejected silver, because Yahweh has rejected them.” </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">9</span> So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Whatever my eyes desired, I didn’t keep from them. I didn’t withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that I had labored to do; and behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no profit under the sun. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly; for what can the king’s successor do? Just that which has been done long ago.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness—and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then I said in my heart, “As it happens to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?” Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory forever, since in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die just like the fool! </span> </span>
