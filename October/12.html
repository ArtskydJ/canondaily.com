Don’t omit a word.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> It may be they will listen, and every man turn from his evil way; that I may relent from the evil which I intend to do to them because of the evil of their doings.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> You shall tell them, “Yahweh says: ‘If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> to listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you, even rising up early and sending them, but you have not listened;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> When Jeremiah had finished speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, “You shall surely die!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Why have you prophesied in Yahweh’s name, saying, ‘This house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant?’ ” All the people were crowded around Jeremiah in Yahweh’s house. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to Yahweh’s house; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, “This man is worthy of death; for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, “Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey Yahweh your God’s voice; then Yahweh will relent from the evil that he has pronounced against you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But as for me, behold, I am in your hand. Do with me what is good and right in your eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Only know for certain that, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for in truth Yahweh has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets: “This man is not worthy of death; for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then certain of the elders of the land rose up, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> “Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“ ‘Zion will be plowed as a field, </span> <span class="line">and Jerusalem will become heaps, </span> <span class="line">and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.’ </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">19</span> Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Didn’t he fear Yahweh, and entreat the favor of Yahweh, and Yahweh relented of the disaster which he had pronounced against them? We would commit great evil against our own souls that way!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> There was also a man who prophesied in Yahweh’s name, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Then Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> and they fetched Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they didn’t give him into the hand of the people to put him to death. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">27</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh says to me: “Make bonds and bars, and put them on your neck.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Then send them to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the children of Ammon, to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Give them a command to their masters, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, “You shall tell your masters:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> ‘I have made the earth, the men, and the animals that are on the surface of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm. I give it to whom it seems right to me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant. I have also given the animals of the field to him to serve him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> All the nations will serve him, his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings will make him their bondservant. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “ ‘ “ ‘It will happen that I will punish the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,’ says Yahweh, ‘with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> But as for you, don’t listen to your prophets, to your diviners, to your dreams, to your soothsayers, or to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, “You shall not serve the king of Babylon;”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, so that I would drive you out, and you would perish.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> But the nation that brings their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, that nation I will let remain in their own land,’ says Yahweh; ‘and they will till it and dwell in it.’ ” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For I have not sent them,” says Yahweh, “but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you, and the prophets who prophesy to you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Yahweh says, “Don’t listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, ‘Behold, the vessels of Yahweh’s house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Don’t listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should this city become a desolation?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But if they are prophets, and if Yahweh’s word is with them, let them now make intercession to Yahweh of Armies, that the vessels which are left in Yahweh’s house, in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, don’t go to Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> For Yahweh of Armies says concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn’t take when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> yes, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning the vessels that are left in Yahweh’s house, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> ‘They will be carried to Babylon, and there they will be, until the day that I visit them,’ says Yahweh; ‘then I will bring them up, and restore them to this place.’ ” </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">15</span> All this I have seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who lives long in his evildoing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Don’t be overly righteous, neither make yourself overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Don’t be too wicked, neither be foolish. Why should you die before your time?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> It is good that you should take hold of this. Yes, also don’t withdraw your hand from that; for he who fears God will come out of them all.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and doesn’t sin.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Also don’t take heed to all words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant curse you;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> for often your own heart knows that you yourself have likewise cursed others.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> All this I have proved in wisdom. I said, “I will be wise;” but it was far from me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> That which is, is far off and exceedingly deep. Who can find it out?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> I turned around, and my heart sought to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know that wickedness is stupidity, and that foolishness is madness. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and traps, whose hands are chains. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner will be ensnared by her. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> “Behold, I have found this,” says the Preacher, “to one another, to find out the scheme  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> which my soul still seeks, but I have not found. I have found one man among a thousand, but I have not found a woman among all those.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Behold, I have only found this: that God made man upright; but they search for many schemes.” </span> </span>

So where do you get that living water?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his children and his livestock?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Jesus answered her, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”</span> </span>
