Perhaps Yahweh will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may withdraw from us.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Then Jeremiah said to them, “Tell Zedekiah:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says, “Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the walls; and I will gather them into the middle of this city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and animal. They will die of a great pestilence.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Afterward,” says Yahweh, “I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, his servants, and the people, even those who are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. He will strike them with the edge of the sword. He will not spare them, have pity, or have mercy.” ’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “You shall say to this people, ‘Yahweh says: “Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he will live, and he will escape with his life.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For I have set my face on this city for evil, and not for good,” says Yahweh. “It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.” ’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “Concerning the house of the king of Judah, hear Yahweh’s word:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> House of David, Yahweh says, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">‘Execute justice in the morning, </span> <span class="line">and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, </span> <span class="line">lest my wrath go out like fire, </span> <span class="line">and burn so that no one can quench it, </span> <span class="line">because of the evil of your doings. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, </span> <span class="line">and of the rock of the plain,’ says Yahweh. </span> <span class="line">‘You that say, “Who would come down against us?” </span> <span class="line">or “Who would enter into our homes?” </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says Yahweh; </span> <span class="line">and I will kindle a fire in her forest, </span> <span class="line">and it will devour all that is around her.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">22</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said, “Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak this word, there:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> ‘Hear Yahweh’s word, king of Judah, who sits on David’s throne, you, your servants, and your people who enter in by these gates.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh says: “Execute justice and righteousness, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor. Do no wrong. Do no violence to the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow. Don’t shed innocent blood in this place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For if you do this thing indeed, then kings sitting on David’s throne will enter in by the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses, he, his servants, and his people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself,” says Yahweh, “that this house will become a desolation.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For Yahweh says concerning the house of the king of Judah: </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“You are Gilead to me, </span> <span class="line">the head of Lebanon. </span> <span class="line">Yet surely I will make you a wilderness, </span> <span class="line">cities which are not inhabited. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> I will prepare destroyers against you, </span> <span class="line">everyone with his weapons, </span> <span class="line">and they will cut down your choice cedars, </span> <span class="line">and cast them into the fire. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “Many nations will pass by this city, and they will each ask his neighbor, ‘Why has Yahweh done this to this great city?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God, worshiped other gods, and served them.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> Don’t weep for the dead. </span> <span class="line">Don’t bemoan him; </span> <span class="line">but weep bitterly for him who goes away, </span> <span class="line">for he will return no more, </span> <span class="line">and not see his native country. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> For Yahweh says touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went out of this place: “He won’t return there any more.  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> But he will die in the place where they have led him captive.

This is vanity, and it is an evil disease. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial; I say, that a stillborn child is better than he:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> for it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it. This has rest rather than the other.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yes, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet fails to enjoy good, don’t all go to one place?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For what advantage has the wise more than the fool? What has the poor man, that knows how to walk before the living?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Whatever has been, its name was given long ago; and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For there are many words that create vanity. What does that profit man?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun? </span> </span>
