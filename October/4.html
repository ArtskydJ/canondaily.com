You shall also call to them, but they will not answer you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> You shall tell them, ‘This is the nation that has not listened to Yahweh their God’s voice, nor received instruction. Truth has perished, and is cut off from their mouth.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Cut off your hair, and throw it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for Yahweh has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> “For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight,” says Yahweh. “They have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I didn’t command, nor did it come into my mind.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Therefore behold, the days come”, says Yahweh, “that it will no more be called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth. No one will frighten them away.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a waste.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> “At that time,” says Yahweh, “they will bring the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of his princes, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> They will spread them before the sun, the moon, and all the army of the sky, which they have loved, which they have served, after which they have walked, which they have sought, and which they have worshiped. They will not be gathered or be buried. They will be like dung on the surface of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Death will be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places where I have driven them,” says Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> “Moreover you shall tell them, ‘Yahweh says: </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“ ‘Do men fall, and not rise up again?
