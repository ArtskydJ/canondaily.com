No one will frighten them away.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a waste.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> “At that time,” says Yahweh, “they will bring the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of his princes, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> They will spread them before the sun, the moon, and all the army of the sky, which they have loved, which they have served, after which they have walked, which they have sought, and which they have worshiped. They will not be gathered or be buried. They will be like dung on the surface of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Death will be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places where I have driven them,” says Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> “Moreover you shall tell them, ‘Yahweh says: </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“ ‘Do men fall, and not rise up again?
