They will not be lamented, neither will they be buried. They will be as dung on the surface of the ground. They will be consumed by the sword and by famine. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For Yahweh says, “Don’t enter into the house of mourning. Don’t go to lament. Don’t bemoan them, for I have taken away my peace from this people,” says Yahweh, “even loving kindness and tender mercies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Both great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried. Men won’t lament for them, cut themselves, or make themselves bald for them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Men won’t break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead. Men won’t give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> It will happen, when you tell this people all these words, and they ask you, ‘Why has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us?’ or ‘What is our iniquity? or ‘What is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> then you shall tell them, ‘Because your fathers have forsaken me,’ says Yahweh, ‘and have walked after other gods, have served them, have worshiped them, have forsaken me, and have not kept my law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> You have done evil more than your fathers, for behold, you each walk after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that you don’t listen to me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore I will cast you out of this land into the land that you have not known, neither you nor your fathers. There you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> “Therefore behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that it will no more be said, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> but, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries where he had driven them.’ I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “Behold, I will send for many fishermen,” says Yahweh, “and they will fish them up.

They are not hidden from my face. Their iniquity isn’t concealed from my eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold, </span> <span class="line">and my refuge in the day of affliction, </span> <span class="line">the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth, </span> <span class="line">and will say, </span> <span class="line">“Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, </span> <span class="line">vanity and things in which there is no profit. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">20</span> Should a man make to himself gods </span> <span class="line">which yet are no gods?” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">21</span> “Therefore behold, I will cause them to know, </span> <span class="line">this once I will cause them to know my hand and my might. </span> <span class="line">Then they will know that my name is Yahweh.” </span> <span class="line"> <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> “The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, </span> <span class="line">and with the point of a diamond. </span> <span class="line">It is engraved on the tablet of their heart, </span> <span class="line">and on the horns of your altars. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> Even their children remember their altars </span> <span class="line">and their Asherah poles by the green trees on the high hills. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> My mountain in the field, </span> <span class="line">I will give your substance and all your treasures for a plunder, </span> <span class="line">and your high places, because of sin, throughout all your borders. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> You, even of yourself, will discontinue from your heritage that I gave you. </span> <span class="line">I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you don’t know, </span> <span class="line">for you have kindled a fire in my anger which will burn forever.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh says: </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Cursed is the man who trusts in man, </span> <span class="line">relies on strength of flesh, </span> <span class="line">and whose heart departs from Yahweh. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> For he will be like a bush in the desert, </span> <span class="line">and will not see when good comes, </span> <span class="line">but will inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, </span> <span class="line">an uninhabited salt land. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> “Blessed is the man who trusts in Yahweh, </span> <span class="line">and whose confidence is in Yahweh. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> For he will be as a tree planted by the waters, </span> <span class="line">who spreads out its roots by the river, </span> <span class="line">and will not fear when heat comes, </span> <span class="line">but its leaf will be green, </span> <span class="line">and will not be concerned in the year of drought. </span> <span class="line">It won’t cease from yielding fruit. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> The heart is deceitful above all things </span> <span class="line">and it is exceedingly corrupt. </span> <span class="line">Who can know it?

Why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, as well as in many words; but you must fear God. </span> </span>
