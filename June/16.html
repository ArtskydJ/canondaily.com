		<span class="header">2 Kings 1-2</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But Yahweh’s</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> angel said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, ‘Is it because there is no God</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Now therefore Yahweh says, “You will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.” ’ ” Then Elijah departed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, “Why is it that you have returned?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> They said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, “Yahweh says, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’ ” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They answered him, “He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “It’s Elijah the Tishbite.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down!’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He answered him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down quickly!’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Then God’s fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, “Man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty of your servants, be precious in your sight.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh’s angel said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then he arose, and went down with him to the king.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> So he died according to Yahweh’s word which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Yahweh was about to take Elijah up by a whirlwind into heaven, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Elijah said to Elisha, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Elisha said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He answered, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Elijah said to him, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” Then they both went on.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He said, “You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so for you; but if not, it will not be so.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> As they continued on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Elisha saw it, and he cried, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He also took up Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He took Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?” When he also had struck the waters, they were divided apart, and Elisha went over.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho facing him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> They said to him, “See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps Yahweh’s Spirit has taken him up, and put him on some mountain, or into some valley.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Don’t send them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Therefore they sent fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go?’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” Then they brought it to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or barren wasteland.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> So the waters were healed to this day, according to Elisha’s word which he spoke. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in Yahweh’s name. Then two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria. </span> </span>
