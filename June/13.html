Then he requested for himself that he might die, and said, “It is enough. Now, O Yahweh, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise and eat!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh’s angel came again the second time, and touched him, and said, “Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, God’s Mountain.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He came to a cave there, and camped there; and behold, Yahweh’s word came to him, and he said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He said, “I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He said, “Go out, and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Behold, Yahweh passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the earthquake.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> After the earthquake a fire passed; but Yahweh was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a still small voice.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle, went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. Behold, a voice came to him, and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He said, “I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel; and anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah to be prophet in your place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Yet I reserved seven thousand in Israel, all the knees of which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth. Elijah went over to him, and put his mantle on him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Elisha left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, “Let me please kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said to him, “Go back again; for what have I done to you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> He returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their meat with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and served him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together; and there were thirty-two kings with him, with horses and chariots. He went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him, “Ben Hadad says,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> ‘Your silver and your gold is mine. Your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The king of Israel answered, “It is according to your saying, my lord, O king. I am yours, and all that I have.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The messengers came again, and said, “Ben Hadad says, ‘I sent indeed to you, saying, “You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they will search your house, and the houses of your servants; whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they will put it in their hand, and take it away.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, “Please notice how this man seeks mischief; for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I didn’t deny him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> All the elders and all the people said to him, “Don’t listen, and don’t consent.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you sent for to your servant at the first I will do; but this thing I cannot do.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The messengers departed, and brought him back the message.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Ben Hadad sent to him, and said, “The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria will be enough for handfuls for all the people who follow me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The king of Israel answered, “Tell him, ‘Don’t let him who puts on his armor brag like he who takes it off.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> When Ben Hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, he said to his servants, “Prepare to attack!” They prepared to attack the city. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand today. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Ahab said, “By whom?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Yahweh says, ‘By the young men of the princes of the provinces.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then he said, “Who shall begin the battle?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He answered, “You.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two. After them, he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> They went out at noon. But Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, “Men are coming out from Samaria.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> They each killed his man. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The servants of the king of Syria said to him, “Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we. But let’s fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Muster an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. We will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they are.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He listened to their voice, and did so.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> At the return of the year, Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> The children of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and went against them. The children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of young goats; but the Syrians filled the country.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘Because the Syrians have said, “Yahweh is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys;” therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> They encamped opposite each other for seven days. So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand footmen of the Syrians in one day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left. Ben Hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner room.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> His servants said to him, “See now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let us put sackcloth on our bodies, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Maybe he will save your life.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> So they put sackcloth on their bodies and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, “Your servant Ben Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Now the men observed diligently, and hurried to take this phrase; and they said, “Your brother Ben Hadad.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then he said, “Go, bring him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then Ben Hadad came out to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Ben Hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore. You shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“I”, said Ahab, “will let you go with this covenant.” So he made a covenant with him, and let him go. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by Yahweh’s word, “Please strike me!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The man refused to strike him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed Yahweh’s voice, behold, as soon as you have departed from me, a lion will kill you.” As soon as he had departed from him, a lion found him and killed him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Then he found another man, and said, “Please strike me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The man struck him and wounded him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said, “Your servant went out into the middle of the battle; and behold, a man came over, and brought a man to me, and said, ‘Guard this man! If by any means he is missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of silver.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be. You yourself have decided it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> He hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized that he was one of the prophets.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> He said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life will take the place of his life, and your people take the place of his people.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> The king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria. </span> </span>

			Proud people have a subconscious feeling, “This ministry/church is privileged to have me and my gifts”; they think of what they can do for God.

			<div class="subheader">Broken</div>
			Broken people’s heart attitude is, “I don’t deserve to have a part in any ministry”; they  know that they have nothing to offer God except the life of Jesus flowing through their  broken lives.
