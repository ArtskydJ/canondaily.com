		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as the heart of David his father.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Nevertheless for David’s sake, Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> because David did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, and didn’t turn away from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Abijam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Asa his son reigned in his place. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Asa did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, as David his father did.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah. Asa cut down her image and burned it at the brook Kidron.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Yahweh all his days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He brought into Yahweh’s house the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that he himself had dedicated: silver, gold, and utensils.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that was left in the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered it into the hand of his servants. Then King Asa sent them to Ben Hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> “There is a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah. No one was exempted. They carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa used it to build Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in his father David’s city; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha killed him, and reigned in his place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> As soon as he was king, he struck all the house of Jeroboam. He didn’t leave to Jeroboam any who breathed, until he had destroyed him; according to the saying of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah for twenty-four years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s word came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Because I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The dogs will eat Baasha’s descendants who die in the city; and he who dies of his in the field, the birds of the sky will eat.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his place. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Moreover Yahweh’s word came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah for two years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> His servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> and Zimri went in and struck him, and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, he attacked all the house of Baasha. He didn’t leave him a single one who urinates on a wall</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> among his relatives or his friends.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The people who were encamped heard that Zimri had conspired, and had also killed the king. Therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the fortified part of the king’s house, and burned the king’s house over him with fire, and died,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he committed, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel for twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirzah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Omri did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and dealt wickedly above all who were before him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his place. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel. Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight above all that were before him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> As if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> He raised up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did more yet to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho. He laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun. </span> </span>

Every tree therefore that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The multitudes asked him, “What then must we do?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He answered them, “He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what must we do?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He said to them, “Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Soldiers also asked him, saying, “What about us? What must we do?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said to them, “Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> John answered them all, “I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen.
