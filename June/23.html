		<span class="header">2 Kings 13-14</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria for seventeen years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Jehoahaz begged Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Syria oppressed them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> (Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Nevertheless they didn’t depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained in Samaria.)  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> For he didn’t leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son reigned in his place. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria for sixteen years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight. He didn’t depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; but he walked in them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat on his throne. Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Now Elisha became sick with the illness of which he died; and Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over him, and said, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Elisha said to him, “Take bow and arrows;” and he took bow and arrows for himself.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow;” and he put his hand on it. Elisha laid his hands on the king’s hands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He said, “Open the window eastward;” and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot!” and he shot. He said, “Yahweh’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for you will strike the Syrians in Aphek, until you have consumed them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He said, “Take the arrows;” and he took them. He said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground;” and he struck three times, and stopped.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times. Then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it; whereas now you will strike Syria just three times.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Elisha died, and they buried him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> As they were burying a man, behold, they saw a band of raiders; and they threw the man into Elisha’s tomb. As soon as the man touched Elisha’s bones, he revived, and stood up on his feet. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> But Yahweh was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect for them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, and he didn’t cast them from his presence as yet. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Joash struck him three times, and recovered the cities of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah began to reign.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, yet not like David his father. He did according to all that Joash his father had done.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> As soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, he killed his servants who had slain the king his father,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> but the children of the murderers he didn’t put to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel, to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let’s look one another in the face.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Enjoy the glory of it, and stay at home; for why should you meddle to your harm, that you fall, even you, and Judah with you?’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Judah was defeated by Israel; and each man fled to his tent.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in Yahweh’s house and in the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his place. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> They made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> They brought him on horses, and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in David’s city. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> He built Elath, and restored it to Judah. After that the king slept with his fathers. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria for forty-one years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight. He didn’t depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, according to Yahweh, the God of Israel’s word, which he spoke by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was from Gath Hepher.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> For Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for all, slave and free, and there was no helper for Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Yahweh didn’t say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he fought, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, for Israel, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his place. </span> </span>
