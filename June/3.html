		<span class="header">1 Kings 3-4</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into David’s city, until he had finished building his own house, Yahweh’s house, and the wall around Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> However the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was not yet a house built for Yahweh’s name.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of David his father; except that he sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> In Gibeon, Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask for what I should give you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Solomon said, “You have shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness, because he walked before you in truth, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you. You have kept for him this great loving kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father. I am just a little child. I don’t know how to go out or come in.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Your servant is among your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can’t be numbered or counted for multitude.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this great people of yours?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> This request pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, nor have you asked for riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> behold, I have done according to your word. Behold, I have given you a wise and understanding heart; so that there has been no one like you before you, and after you none will arise like you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> I have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you for all your days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, and offered up burnt offerings, offered peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king, and stood before him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The one woman said, “Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. I delivered a child with her in the house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The third day after I delivered, this woman delivered also. We were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, just us two in the house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> This woman’s child died in the night, because she lay on it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your servant slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I bore.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The other woman said, “No; but the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The first one said, “No; but the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son.” They argued like this before the king. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Then the king said, “One says, ‘This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead;’ and the other says, ‘No; but your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The king said, “Get me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> The king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Then the woman whose the living child was spoke to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no way kill him!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">But the other said, “He shall be neither mine nor yours. Divide him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Then the king answered, “Give her the living child, and definitely do not kill him. She is his mother.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> All Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> King Solomon was king over all Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> These were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, the king’s friend;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household. Each man had to make provision for a month in the year.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> These are their names: Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Ben Deker, in Makaz, in Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (Socoh and all the land of Hepher belonged to him);  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath, Solomon’s daughter, as wife);  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, belonged to him; and the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars, belonged to him);  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife);  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer who was in the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Judah and Israel were numerous as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty cors</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of fine flour, sixty measures of meal,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> ten head of fat cattle, twenty head of cattle out of the pastures, and one hundred sheep, in addition to deer, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fattened fowl.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> For he had dominion over all on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides around him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon’s table, every man in his month. They let nothing be lacking.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> They also brought Barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where the officers were, each man according to his duty.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> God gave Solomon abundant wisdom and understanding, and very great understanding, even as the sand that is on the seashore.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations all around.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> He spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs numbered one thousand five.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows out of the wall; he also spoke of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and of fish.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> People of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, sent by all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom. </span> </span>
