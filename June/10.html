		<span class="header">1 Kings 13-14</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, a man of God came out of Judah by Yahweh’s word to Bethel; and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He cried against the altar by Yahweh’s word, and said, “Altar! Altar! Yahweh says: ‘Behold, a son will be born to David’s house, Josiah by name. On you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and they will burn men’s bones on you.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken: Behold, the altar will be split apart, and the ashes that are on it will be poured out.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> When the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam put out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” His hand, which he put out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to himself.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The altar was also split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by Yahweh’s word.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The king answered the man of God, “Now intercede for the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The man of God interceded with Yahweh, and the king’s hand was restored to him again, and became as it was before. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The king said to the man of God, “Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The man of God said to the king, “Even if you gave me half of your house, I would not go in with you, neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> for so was it commanded me by Yahweh’s word, saying, ‘You shall eat no bread, drink no water, and don’t return by the way that you came.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> So he went another way, and didn’t return by the way that he came to Bethel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Now an old prophet lived in Bethel, and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went, who came from Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. He said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I am.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then he said to him, “Come home with me, and eat bread.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He said, “I may not return with you, nor go in with you. I will not eat bread or drink water with you in this place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> For it was said to me by Yahweh’s word, ‘You shall eat no bread or drink water there, and don’t turn again to go by the way that you came.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He said to him, “I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel spoke to me by Yahweh’s word, saying, ‘Bring him back with you into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.’ ” He lied to him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> So he went back with him, ate bread in his house, and drank water.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> As they sat at the table, Yahweh’s word came to the prophet who brought him back;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have been disobedient to Yahweh’s mouth, and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> but came back, and have eaten bread and drank water in the place of which he said to you, “Eat no bread, and drink no water;” your body will not come to the tomb of your fathers.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> After he had eaten bread, and after he drank, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> When he had gone, a lion met him by the way and killed him. His body was thrown on the path, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the body.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Behold, men passed by, and saw the body thrown on the path, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who was disobedient to Yahweh’s mouth. Therefore Yahweh has delivered him to the lion, which has mauled him and slain him, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke to him.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> He said to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me,” and they saddled it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> He went and found his body thrown on the path, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body, nor mauled the donkey.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. He came to the city of the old prophet to mourn, and to bury him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> He laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> After he had buried him, he spoke to his sons, saying, “When I am dead, bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> For the saying which he cried by Yahweh’s word against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely happen.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> After this thing Jeroboam didn’t return from his evil way, but again made priests of the high places from among all the people. Whoever wanted to, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please get up and disguise yourself, so that you won’t be recognized as Jeroboam’s wife. Go to Shiloh. Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who said that I would be king over this people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the child.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to Ahijah’s house. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh said to Ahijah, “Behold, Jeroboam’s wife is coming to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick. Tell her such and such; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, he said, “Come in, Jeroboam’s wife! Why do you pretend to be another? For I am sent to you with heavy news.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: “Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over my people Israel,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> and tore the kingdom away from David’s house, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods, molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweeps away dung, until it is all gone.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The dogs will eat he who belongs to Jeroboam who dies in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field: for Yahweh has spoken it.” ’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Arise therefore, and go to your house. When your feet enter into the city, the child will die.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> All Israel will mourn for him and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam will come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Moreover Yahweh will raise up a king for himself over Israel, who will cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is the day! What? Even now.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking Yahweh to anger.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> All Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty two years, then he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Judah did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> There were also sodomites in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> In the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> and he took away the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house. He even took away all of it, including all the gold shields which Solomon had made.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> It was so, that as often as the king went into Yahweh’s house, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard room. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam his son reigned in his place. </span> </span>
