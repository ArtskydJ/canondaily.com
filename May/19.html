		<span class="header">2 Samuel 4-5</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Saul’s son had two men who were captains of raiding bands. The name of one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is considered a part of Benjamin:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until today).  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news came about Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse picked him up and fled. As she hurried to flee, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> They came there into the middle of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him, killed him, beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life! Yahweh has avenged my lord the king today of Saul, and of his offspring.</span> <span class="paragraphtext">” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> when someone told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ thinking that he brought good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, should I not now require his blood from your hand, and rid the earth of you?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> David commanded his young men, and they killed them, cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in Abner’s grave in Hebron. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and spoke, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led Israel out and in. Yahweh said to you, ‘You will be shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be prince over Israel.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “The blind and the lame will keep you out of here;” thinking, “David can’t come in here.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. This is David’s city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him go up to the watercourse and strike those lame and blind, who are hated by David’s soul.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame can’t come into the house.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> David lived in the stronghold, and called it David’s city. David built around from Millo and inward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies, was with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, with cedar trees, carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> David took more concubines and wives for himself out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Yahweh said to David, “Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there. Then he said, “Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They left their images there; and David and his men took them away. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> When David inquired of Yahweh, he said, “You shall not go up. Circle around behind them, and attack them in front of the mulberry trees.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then stir yourself up; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines all the way from Geba to Gezer. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> For they said, “Not during the feast, because there might be a riot among the people.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard—very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> But there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, “Why has this ointment been wasted?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and given to the poor.” So they grumbled against her. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But Jesus said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Leave her alone.

She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her.”</span> </span>

		<span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">11</span> I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for I am in no way inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty works.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Even so, I myself didn’t burden you. “But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Did I take advantage of you by anyone of those whom I have sent to you?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we walk in the same spirit? Didn’t we walk in the same steps? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don’t desire, that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, or riots,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness, sexual immorality, and lustfulness which they committed. </span> </span>
