		<span class="header">1 Samuel 1-2</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He had two wives. The name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> but to Hannah he gave a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Her rival provoked her severely, to irritate her, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> So year by year, when she went up to Yahweh’s house, her rival provoked her. Therefore she wept, and didn’t eat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> So Hannah rose up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh’s temple.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, weeping bitterly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> She vowed a vow, and said, “Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed look at the affliction of your servant and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> As she continued praying before Yahweh, Eli saw her mouth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Get rid of your wine!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Don’t consider your servant a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; and may the God</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> She said, “Let your servant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate; and her facial expression wasn’t sad any more. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> They rose up in the morning early and worshiped Yahweh, then returned and came to their house to Ramah. Then Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> When the time had come, Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> saying, “Because I have asked him of Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice and his vow.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> But Hannah didn’t go up, for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and stay there forever.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may Yahweh establish his word.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">So the woman waited and nursed her son until she weaned him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of meal, and a container of wine, and brought him to Yahweh’s house in Shiloh. The child was young.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> She said, “Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> I prayed for this child, and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Therefore I have also given him to Yahweh. As long as he lives he is given to Yahweh.” He worshiped Yahweh there. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Hannah prayed, and said: </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“My heart exults in Yahweh! </span> <span class="line">My horn is exalted in Yahweh. </span> <span class="line">My mouth is enlarged over my enemies, </span> <span class="line">because I rejoice in your salvation. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> There is no one as holy as Yahweh, </span> <span class="line">for there is no one besides you, </span> <span class="line">nor is there any rock like our God. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> “Don’t keep talking so exceedingly proudly. </span> <span class="line">Don’t let arrogance come out of your mouth, </span> <span class="line">for Yahweh is a God of knowledge. </span> <span class="line">By him actions are weighed. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> “The bows of the mighty men are broken. </span> <span class="line">Those who stumbled are armed with strength. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread. </span> <span class="line">Those who were hungry are satisfied. </span> <span class="line">Yes, the barren has borne seven. </span> <span class="line">She who has many children languishes. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> “Yahweh kills and makes alive. </span> <span class="line">He brings down to Sheol</span> <span class="line"> and brings up. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh makes poor and makes rich. </span> <span class="line">He brings low, he also lifts up. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> He raises up the poor out of the dust. </span> <span class="line">He lifts up the needy from the dunghill </span> <span class="line">to make them sit with princes </span> <span class="line">and inherit the throne of glory. </span> <span class="line">For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh’s. </span> <span class="line">He has set the world on them. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> He will keep the feet of his holy ones, </span> <span class="line">but the wicked will be put to silence in darkness; </span> <span class="line">for no man will prevail by strength. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces. </span> <span class="line">He will thunder against them in the sky. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth. </span> <span class="line">He will give strength to his king, </span> <span class="line">and exalt the horn of his anointed.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served Yahweh before Eli the priest. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Now the sons of Eli were wicked men. They didn’t know Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The custom of the priests with the people was that when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant came while the meat was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> and he stabbed it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot. The priest took all that the fork brought up for himself. They did this to all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yes, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires;” then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised Yahweh’s offering.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, “May Yahweh give you offspring</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> from this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.” Then they went to their own home.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they slept with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I hear! You make Yahweh’s people disobey.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> If one man sins against another, God will judge him; but if a man sins against Yahweh, who will intercede for him?” Notwithstanding, they didn’t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh intended to kill them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh and also with men. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> A man of God came to Eli and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Did I reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Didn’t I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? Didn’t I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> “Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house and the house of your father should walk before me forever.’ But now Yahweh says, ‘Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me will be cursed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> the days come that I will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house, that there will not be an old man in your house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> You will see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I will give Israel. There shall not be an old man in your house forever.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> The man of yours whom I don’t cut off from my altar will consume your eyes</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and grieve your heart. All the increase of your house will die in the flower of their age.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> This will be the sign to you that will come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they will both die.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> I will raise up a faithful priest for myself who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house. He will walk before my anointed forever.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> It will happen that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, “Please put me into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.” ’ ” </span> </span>
