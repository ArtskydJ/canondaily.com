		<span class="header">2 Samuel 18</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">18</span><span class="verse">1</span> David counted the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> David sent the people out, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, “I will also surely go out with you myself.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But the people said, “You shall not go out; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The king said to them, “I will do what seems best to you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.” All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The people of Israel were struck there before David’s servants, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Absalom happened to meet David’s servants. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Joab said to the man who told him, “Behold, you saw it, and why didn’t you strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The man said to Joab, “Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn’t stretch out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware that no one touch the young man Absalom.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Then Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this with you.” He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the middle of the oak.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held the people back.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> They took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled, each to his own tent.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king’s valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in memory.” He called the pillar after his own name. It is called Absalom’s monument, to this day. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me now run and carry the king news, how Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Joab said to him, “You must not be the bearer of news today, but you must carry news another day. But today you must carry no news, because the king’s son is dead.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen!” The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, “But come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Joab said, “Why do you want to run, my son, since you will have no reward for the news?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> “But come what may,” he said, “I will run.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said to him, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> The watchman cried, and told the king. The king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” He came closer and closer. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gatekeeper, and said, “Behold, a man running alone!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The king said, “He also brings news.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> The watchman said, “I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good news.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, “All is well.” He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, “Blessed is Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> The king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don’t know what it was.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> The king said, “Come and stand here.” He came, and stood still. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Behold, the Cushite came. The Cushite said, “News for my lord the king, for Yahweh has avenged you today of all those who rose up against you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> The king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> The king was much moved, and went up to the room over the gate, and wept. As he went, he said, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!” </span> </span>

They led him out to crucify him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> It was the third hour, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and they crucified him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> The superscription of his accusation was written over him, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, “He was counted with transgressors.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Ha!

You did me no wrong,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> but you know that because of weakness in the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn’t despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> What was the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> They zealously seek you in no good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you—  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you. </span> </span>
