		<span class="header">1 Samuel 24-25</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Saul had returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were staying in the innermost parts of the cave.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> David’s men said to him, “Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.’ ” Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe secretly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Afterward, David’s heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He said to his men, “Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, since he is Yahweh’s anointed.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> So David checked his men with these words, and didn’t allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and showed respect.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to men’s words, saying, ‘Behold, David seeks to harm you?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, today your eyes have seen how Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave. Some urged me to kill you; but I spared you; and I said, I will not stretch out my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh’s anointed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn’t kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> May Yahweh judge between me and you, and may Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand will not be on you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness;’ but my hand will not be on you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> May Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> It came to pass, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> You have declared today how you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn’t kill me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me today.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father’s house.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> David swore to Saul. Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">25</span><span class="verse">1</span> Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and mourned for him, and buried him at his house at Ramah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail. This woman was intelligent and had a beautiful face; but the man was surly and evil in his doings. He was of the house of Caleb.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Tell him, ‘Long life to you! Peace be to you! Peace be to your house! Peace be to all that you have!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we didn’t harm them. Nothing was missing from them all the time they were in Carmel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come on a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal all those words in the name of David, and waited. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants who break away from their masters these days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Shall I then take my bread, my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don’t know where they come from?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him all these words. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> David said to his men, “Every man put on his sword!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Every man put on his sword. David also put on his sword. About four hundred men followed David, and two hundred stayed by the baggage.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to Greet our master; and he insulted them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> But the men were very good to us, and we were not harmed, and we didn’t miss anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can’t speak to him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two containers of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five seahs</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of parched grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> She said to her young men, “Go on before me. Behold, I am coming after you.” But she didn’t tell her husband, Nabal.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> As she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned me evil for good.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got off her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> She fell at his feet, and said, “On me, my lord, on me be the blame! Please let your servant speak in your ears. Hear the words of your servant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Please don’t let my lord pay attention to this worthless fellow, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he. Nabal</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your servant, didn’t see my lord’s young men, whom you sent.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Now therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, since Yahweh has withheld you from blood guiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights Yahweh’s battles. Evil will not be found in you all your days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Though men may rise up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord will be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God. He will sling out the souls of your enemies, as from the hollow of a sling.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> It will come to pass, when Yahweh has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you prince over Israel,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. When Yahweh has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> David said to Abigail, “Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, who have kept me today from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> For indeed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from harming you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn’t have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> So David received from her hand that which she had brought him. Then he said to her, “Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have granted your request.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. Therefore she told him nothing until the morning light.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> About ten days later, Yahweh struck Nabal, so that he died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed is Yahweh, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil. Yahweh has returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head.” David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to himself as wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> When David’s servants had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, “Behold, your servant is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they both became his wives.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim. </span> </span>

		<span class="header">2 Corinthians 9</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to those of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for the past year. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> lest by any means, if anyone from Macedonia comes there with me and finds you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) would be disappointed in this confident boasting.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Remember this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> As it is written, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“He has scattered abroad.

	<div class="subheader">Proud vs. Broken</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Proud</div>
		Proud people have a subconscious feeling, “This ministry/church is privileged to have me and my gifts”; they think of what they can do for God.
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Broken</div>
		Broken people’s heart attitude is, “I don’t deserve to have a part in any ministry”; they  know that they have nothing to offer God except the life of Jesus flowing through their  broken lives.
