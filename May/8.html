Now therefore listen to the voice of Yahweh’s words.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh of Armies says, ‘I remember what Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way, when he came up out of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don’t spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Saul summoned the people, and counted them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Saul came to the city of Amalek, and set an ambush in the valley.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, of the cattle, and of the fat calves, and the lambs, and all that was good, and were not willing to utterly destroy them; but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to Samuel, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.” Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and Samuel was told, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, “You are blessed by Yahweh! I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Samuel said, “Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. We have utterly destroyed the rest.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh said to me last night.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said to him, “Say on.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Samuel said, “Though you were little in your own sight, weren’t you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, ‘Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Why then didn’t you obey Yahweh’s voice, but took the plunder, and did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed Yahweh’s voice, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> But the people took of the plunder, sheep and cattle, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Samuel said, “Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying Yahweh’s voice? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> Because you have rejected Yahweh’s word, he has also rejected you from being king.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected Yahweh’s word, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> As Samuel turned around to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Samuel said to him, “Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Then he said, “I have sinned; yet please honor me now before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> So Samuel went back with Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag the king of the Amalekites here to me!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women!” Then Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Yahweh grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided a king for myself among his sons.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Yahweh said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> When they had come, he looked at Eliab, and said, “Surely Yahweh’s anointed is before him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Don’t look on his face, or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for I don’t see as man sees. For man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen these.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your children here?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “There remains yet the youngest. Behold, he is keeping the sheep.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with a handsome face and good appearance. Yahweh said, “Arise! Anoint him, for this is he.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers. Then Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Now Yahweh’s Spirit departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Saul’s servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Let our lord now command your servants who are in front of you to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. Then when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will play with his hand, and you will be well.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then one of the young men answered, and said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and Yahweh is with him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a container of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> David came to Saul, and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> When the spirit from God was on Saul, David took the harp, and played with his hand; so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. </span> </span>
