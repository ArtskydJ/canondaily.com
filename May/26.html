		<span class="header">2 Samuel 16-17</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> When David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a container of wine.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The king said to Ziba, “What do you mean by these?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that those who are faint in the wilderness may drink.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The king said, “Where is your master’s son?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem; for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Ziba said, “I bow down. Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of Saul’s house came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out and cursed as he came.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Shimei said when he cursed, “Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and wicked fellow!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of Saul’s house, in whose place you have reigned! Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son! Behold, you are caught by your own mischief, because you are a man of blood!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, ‘Curse David;’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, “Behold, my son, who came out of my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will repay me good for the cursing of me today.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him, and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and threw dust.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, had come to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Hushai said to Absalom, “No; but whomever Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, I will be his, and I will stay with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn’t I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so I will be in your presence.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel what we shall do.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the inner sanctuary of God. All the counsel of Ahithophel both was like this with David and with Absalom. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with him will flee. I will strike the king only,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let’s hear likewise what he says.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken like this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Hushai said moreover, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> So we will come on him in some place where he will be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground, then we will not leave so much as one of him and of all the men who are with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Moreover, if he has gone into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there isn’t one small stone found there.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, ‘Don’t lodge tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David. For they might not be seen to come into the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But a boy saw them, and told Absalom. Then they both went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and spread out crushed grain on it; and nothing was known.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The woman said to them, “They have gone over the brook of water.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> After they had departed, they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, “Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> When David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, roasted grain,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> honey, butter, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat; for they said, “The people are hungry, weary, and thirsty in the wilderness.” </span> </span>

		<span class="header">Galatians 3:15-29</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">15</span> Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void or adds to it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> He doesn’t say, “To descendants</span> <span class="paragraphtext">”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring”,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> which is Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Now I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Then why is there the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> But the Scripture imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring and heirs according to promise. </span> </span>

		Broken people take the initiative to be reconciled when there is misunderstanding or  conflict in relationships; they race to the cross; they see if they can get there first, no  matter how wrong the other may have been.
