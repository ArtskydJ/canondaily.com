		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">23</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now these are the last words of David. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">David the son of Jesse says, </span> <span class="line">the man who was raised on high says, </span> <span class="line">the anointed of the God of Jacob, </span> <span class="line">the sweet psalmist of Israel: </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> “Yahweh’s Spirit spoke by me. </span> <span class="line">His word was on my tongue. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> The God of Israel said, </span> <span class="line">the Rock of Israel spoke to me, </span> <span class="line">‘One who rules over men righteously, </span> <span class="line">who rules in the fear of God, </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, </span> <span class="line">a morning without clouds, </span> <span class="line">when the tender grass springs out of the earth, </span> <span class="line">through clear shining after rain.’ </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> Isn’t my house so with God? </span> <span class="line">Yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, </span> <span class="line">ordered in all things, and sure, </span> <span class="line">for it is all my salvation, and all my desire, </span> <span class="line">although he doesn’t make it grow. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> But all the ungodly will be as thorns to be thrust away, </span> <span class="line">because they can’t be taken with the hand, </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear. </span> <span class="line">They will be utterly burned with fire in their place.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; he was called Adino the Eznite, who killed eight hundred at one time.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel had gone away.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand froze to the sword; and Yahweh worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take plunder.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines had gathered together into a troop, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But he stood in the middle of the plot and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> David longed, and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David; but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He said, “Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this! Isn’t this the blood of the men who risked their lives to go?” Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Wasn’t he most honorable of the three? Therefore he was made their captain. However he wasn’t included as one of the three.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit in a time of snow.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> He killed a huge Egyptian, and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three. David set him over his guard.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty: Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> and Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> Again Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, “Go, count Israel and Judah.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him, “Now go back and forth through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and count the people, that I may know the sum of the people.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Joab said to the king, “Now may Yahweh your God add to the people, however many they may be, one hundred times; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king delight in this thing?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan, and around to Sidon,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Joab gave up the sum of the counting of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> David’s heart struck him after he had counted the people. David said to Yahweh, “I have sinned greatly in that which I have done. But now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When David rose up in the morning, Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> “Go and speak to David, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land? Now answer, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let us fall now into Yahweh’s hand; for his mercies are great. Let me not fall into man’s hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the appointed time; and seventy thousand men died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, “Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me, and against my father’s house.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Gad came that day to David, and said to him, “Go up, build an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Araunah looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. Then Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">David said, “To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar to Yahweh, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold, the cattle for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> All this, O king, does Araunah give to the king.” Araunah said to the king, “May Yahweh your God accept you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The king said to Araunah, “No; but I will most certainly buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of silver.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So Yahweh was entreated for the land, and the plague was removed from Israel. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For each man will bear his own burden. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Let’s not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don’t give up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> As many as desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised; just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.
