		<span class="header">1 Samuel 22-23</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">22</span><span class="verse">1</span> David therefore departed from there, and escaped to Adullam’s cave. When his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became captain over them. There were with him about four hundred men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother come out with you, until I know what God will do for me.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He brought them before the king of Moab; and they lived with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The prophet Gad said to David, “Don’t stay in the stronghold. Depart, and go into the land of Judah.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Saul heard that David was discovered, with the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Saul said to his servants who stood around him, “Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one who discloses to me when my son makes a treaty with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as it is today?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He inquired of Yahweh for him, gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob; and they all came to the king.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Saul said, “Hear now, you son of Ahitub.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He answered, “Here I am, my lord.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as it is today?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, “Who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, captain of your body guard, and honored in your house?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? Be it far from me! Don’t let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father’s house.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The king said to the guard who stood about him, “Turn, and kill the priests of Yahweh; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and didn’t disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king wouldn’t put out their hand to fall on the priests of Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The king said to Doeg, “Turn and attack the priests!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five people who wore a linen ephod.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing babies, and cattle and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh’s priests. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Stay with me. Don’t be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. For you will be safe with me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">23</span><span class="verse">1</span> David was told, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Therefore David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go and strike these Philistines?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Yahweh said to David, “Go strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> David’s men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then David inquired of Yahweh yet again. Yahweh answered him, and said, “Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Saul was told that David had come to Keilah. Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in by entering into a town that has gates and bars.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Then David said, “O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Yahweh said, “He will come down.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Yahweh said, “They will deliver you up.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. Saul was told that David was escaped from Keilah; and he gave up going there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God didn’t deliver him into his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose, and went to David into the woods, and strengthened his hand in God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He said to him, “Don’t be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father won’t find you; and you will be king over Israel, and I will be next to you; and Saul my father knows that also.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> They both made a covenant before Yahweh. Then David stayed in the woods, and Jonathan went to his house. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the woods, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Now therefore, O king, come down. According to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part will be to deliver him up into the king’s hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Saul said, “You are blessed by Yahweh; for you have had compassion on me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Please go make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there; for I have been told that he is very cunning.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come again to me with certainty, and I will go with you. It shall happen, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard that, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David hurried to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> So Saul returned from pursuing David, and went against the Philistines. Therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">18</span> Some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him. They asked him, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> “Teacher, Moses wrote to us, ‘If a man’s brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Jesus answered them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Isn’t this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God? </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> But about the dead, that they are raised; haven’t you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.”</span> </span>
