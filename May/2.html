		<span class="header">1 Samuel 3-4</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli. Yahweh’s word was rare in those days. There were not many visions, then.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> At that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and God’s lamp hadn’t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in Yahweh’s temple where God’s ark was,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh called Samuel. He said, “Here I am.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I didn’t call. Lie down again.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He went and lay down.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh called yet again, “Samuel!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He answered, “I didn’t call, my son. Lie down again.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now Samuel didn’t yet know Yahweh, neither was Yahweh’s word yet revealed to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down. It shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say, ‘Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant hears.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh said to Samuel, “Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he didn’t restrain them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be removed with sacrifice or offering forever.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of Yahweh’s house. Samuel was afraid to show Eli the vision.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Here I am.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He said, “What is the thing that he has spoken to you? Please don’t hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “It is Yahweh. Let him do what seems good to him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by Yahweh’s word. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word of Samuel came to all Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. When they joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> When the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let’s get the ark of Yahweh’s covenant out of Shiloh and bring it to us, that it may come among us and save us out of the hand of our enemies.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits above the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> When the ark of Yahweh’s covenant came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” They understood that Yahweh’s ark had come into the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” They said, “Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Be strong and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter; for thirty thousand footmen of Israel fell.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> God’s ark was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> A man of Benjamin ran out of the army and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for God’s ark. When the man came into the city and told about it, all the city cried out.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, “What does the noise of this tumult mean?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The man hurried, and came and told Eli.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Now Eli was ninety-eight years old. His eyes were set, so that he could not see.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The man said to Eli, “I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “How did the matter go, my son?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He who brought the news answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and God’s ark has been captured.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> When he made mention of God’s ark, Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died, for he was an old man and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to giving birth. When she heard the news that God’s ark was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth; for her pains came on her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” But she didn’t answer, neither did she regard it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> She named the child Ichabod,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> saying, “The glory has departed from Israel!” because God’s ark was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> She said, “The glory has departed from Israel; for God’s ark has been taken.” </span> </span>
