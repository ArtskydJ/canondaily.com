		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now the Philistines had taken God’s ark, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The Philistines took God’s ark, and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it by Dagon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> When the people of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before Yahweh’s ark. They took Dagon and set him in his place again.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> When they arose early on the following morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before Yahweh’s ark; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold. Only Dagon’s torso was intact.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon’s house step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But Yahweh’s hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod, and he destroyed them and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod and its borders. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us, for his hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to Gath.” They carried the ark of the God of Israel there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> It was so, that after they had carried it there, Yahweh’s hand was against the city with a very great confusion; and he struck the men of the city, both small and great, so that tumors broke out on them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> So they sent God’s ark to Ekron. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">As God’s ark came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel here to us, to kill us and our people.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, “Send the ark of the God of Israel away, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly panic throughout all the city. The hand of God was very heavy there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The men who didn’t die were struck with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s ark was in the country of the Philistines seven months.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with Yahweh’s ark? Show us how we should send it to its place.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, don’t send it empty; but by all means return a trespass offering to him. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then they said, “What should the trespass offering be which we shall return to him?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said, “Five golden tumors and five golden mice, for the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will release his hand from you, from your gods, and from your land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had worked wonderfully among them, didn’t they let the people go, and they departed? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart and two milk cows on which there has come no yoke; and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> and take Yahweh’s ark and lay it on the cart. Put the jewels of gold, which you return him for a trespass offering, in a box by its side; and send it away, that it may go.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Behold, if it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil; but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us. It was a chance that happened to us.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The men did so, and took two milk cows and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> They put Yahweh’s ark on the cart, and the box with the golden mice and the images of their tumors.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh. They went along the highway, lowing as they went, and didn’t turn away to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The people of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there, where there was a great stone. Then they split the wood of the cart and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The Levites took down Yahweh’s ark and the box that was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone; and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to Yahweh: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even to the great stone on which they set down Yahweh’s ark. That stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He struck of the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into Yahweh’s ark, he struck fifty thousand seventy of the men. Then the people mourned, because Yahweh had struck the people with a great slaughter.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The men of Beth Shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? To whom shall he go up from us?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back Yahweh’s ark. Come down and bring it up to yourselves.” </span> </span>

For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn’t find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved and in those who perish:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> to the one a stench from death to death, to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God.
