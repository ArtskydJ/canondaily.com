		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">30</span><span class="verse">1</span> When David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the South, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> and had taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They didn’t kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters were taken captive.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> David’s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the souls of all the people were grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring the ephod here to me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Abiathar brought the ephod to David.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “If I pursue after this troop, will I overtake them?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He answered him, “Pursue; for you will surely overtake them, and will without fail recover all.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn’t go over the brook Besor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, and drank no water for three days and three nights.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> David asked him, “To whom do you belong? Where are you from?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I got sick.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> David said to him, “Will you bring me down to this troop?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me and not deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating, drinking, and dancing, because of all the great plunder that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped from there, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither plunder, nor anything that they had taken to them. David brought back all.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said, “This is David’s plunder.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. When David came near to the people, he greeted them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Then all the wicked men and worthless fellows, of those who went with David, answered and said, “Because they didn’t go with us, we will not give them anything of the plunder that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Then David said, “Do not do so, my brothers, with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays with the baggage. They shall share alike.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, “Behold, a present for you from the plunder of Yahweh’s enemies.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> He sent it to those who were in Bethel, to those who were in Ramoth of the South, to those who were in Jattir,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> to those who were in Aroer, to those who were in Siphmoth, to those who were in Eshtemoa,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> to those who were in Racal, to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> to those who were in Hormah, to those who were in Borashan, to those who were in Athach,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">31</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The Philistines overtook Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me!” But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> They cut off his head, stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> all the valiant men arose, went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burned them there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. </span> </span>

For I married you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we didn’t preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you didn’t receive, or a different “good news”, which you didn’t accept, you put up with that well enough.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But though I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not unskilled in knowledge. No, in every way we have been revealed to you in all things.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you God’s Good News free of charge?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> I robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that I might serve you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When I was present with you and was in need, I wasn’t a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my need. In everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and I will continue to do so.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> As the truth of Christ is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Why? Because I don’t love you? God knows.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from those who desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as we.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as Christ’s apostles.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works. </span> </span>
