		<span class="header">1 Samuel 18-19</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">18</span><span class="verse">1</span> When he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Saul took him that day, and wouldn’t let him go home to his father’s house any more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his clothing, even including his sword, his bow, and his sash.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely; and Saul set him over the men of war. It was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> As they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The women sang to one another as they played, and said, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Saul has slain his thousands, </span> <span class="line">and David his ten thousands.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, “They have creditd David with ten thousands, and they have only credited me with thousands. What can he have more but the kingdom?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Saul watched David from that day and forward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> On the next day, an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul, and he prophesied in the middle of the house. David played with his hand, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> and Saul threw the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” David escaped from his presence twice.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him, and had departed from Saul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore Saul removed him from his presence, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Yahweh was with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Saul said to David, “Behold, my elder daughter Merab, I will give her to you as wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight Yahweh’s battles.” For Saul said, “Don’t let my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> But at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, “You shall today be my son-in-law a second time.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Saul commanded his servants, “Talk with David secretly, and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. David said, “Does it seem to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man, and little known?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The servants of Saul told him, saying, “David spoke like this.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Saul said, “Tell David, ‘The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies.’ ” Now Saul thought he would make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> When his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. Before the deadline,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> David arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David; and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Saul was even more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Then the princes of the Philistines went out; and as often as they went out, David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">19</span><span class="verse">1</span> Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, greatly delighted in David.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Jonathan told David, saying, “Saul my father seeks to kill you. Now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning, and live in a secret place, and hide yourself.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will talk with my father about you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Don’t let the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, “As Yahweh lives, he shall not be put to death.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as before.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> There was war again. David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> An evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled, and escaped that night.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Saul sent messengers to David’s house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning. Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you don’t save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> So Michal let David down through the window. He went away, fled, and escaped.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Michal took the teraphim,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head, and covered it with clothes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats’ hair at its head. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Now David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Saul was told, saying, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Saul sent messengers to seize David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, God’s Spirit came on Saul’s messengers, and they also prophesied.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">One said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then God’s Spirit came on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> He began to speak to them in parables. </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the wine press, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> But those farmers said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do?

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">8</span> For though I grieved you with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I see that my letter made you grieve, though just for a while.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> I now rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you were grieved to repentance. For you were grieved in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For godly sorrow produces repentance to salvation, which brings no regret. But the sorrow of the world produces death.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For behold, this same thing, that you were grieved in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore we have been comforted. In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf, I was not disappointed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> His affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> I rejoice that in everything I am confident concerning you. </span> </span>
