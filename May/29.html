		<span class="header">2 Samuel 20-21</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> There happened to be there a wicked fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the trumpet, and said, “We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, Israel!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance, but didn’t go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then the king said to Amasa, “Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be here present.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get himself fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Joab’s men went out after him, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was clothed in his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a sash with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went along it fell out.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand. So he struck him with it in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn’t strike him again; and he died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> One of Joab’s young men stood by him, and said, “He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah, and all the Berites. They were gathered together, and went also after him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Then a wise woman cried out of the city, “Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, ‘Come near here, that I may speak with you.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He came near to her; and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He answered, “I am.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your servant.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He answered, “I’m listening.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then she spoke, saying, “They used to say in old times, ‘They shall surely ask counsel at Abel;’ and so they settled a matter.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> I am among those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up Yahweh’s inheritance?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Joab answered, “Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The matter is not so. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David. Just deliver him, and I will depart from the city.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Now Joab was over all the army of Israel, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor, Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> and Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">1</span> There was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Yahweh. Yahweh said, “It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the children of Israel had sworn to them; and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and David said to the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? And with what should I make atonement, that you may bless Yahweh’s inheritance?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The Gibeonites said to him, “It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I will do for you whatever you say.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> They said to the king, “The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The king said, “I will give them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Yahweh’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the mountain before Yahweh, and all seven of them fell together. They were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water poured on them from the sky. She allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals of the field by night.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> So David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son. They also gathered the bones of those who were hanged.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer for the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. David grew faint;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze in weight, he being armed with a new sword, thought he would kill David.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “Don’t go out with us to battle any more, so that you don’t quench the lamp of Israel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> After this, there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite’s brother, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on every hand, and six toes on every foot, twenty four in count; and he also was born to the giant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, killed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. </span> </span>
