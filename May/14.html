		<span class="header">1 Samuel 26-27</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">26</span><span class="verse">1</span> The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had certainly come.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army. Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay around him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered up your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore please let me strike him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against Yahweh’s anointed, and be guiltless?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> David said, “As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh forbid that I should stretch out my hand against Yahweh’s anointed; but now please take the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let’s go.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul’s head; and they went away: and no man saw it, or knew it, nor did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Yahweh had fallen on them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Don’t you answer, Abner?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then Abner answered, “Who are you who cries to the king?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> David said to Abner, “Aren’t you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord, the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> This thing isn’t good that you have done. As Yahweh lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, Yahweh’s anointed. Now see where the king’s spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Saul knew David’s voice, and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He said, “Why does my lord pursue his servant? For what have I done? What evil is in my hand?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is so that Yahweh has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering. But if it is the children of men, they are cursed before Yahweh; for they have driven me out today that I shouldn’t cling to Yahweh’s inheritance, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods!’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Now therefore, don’t let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes today. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> David answered, “Behold the spear, O king! Then let one of the young men come over and get it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today, and I wouldn’t stretch out my hand against Yahweh’s anointed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Behold, as your life was respected today in my eyes, so let my life be respected in Yahweh’s eyes, and let him deliver me out of all oppression.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Then Saul said to David, “You are blessed, my son David. You will both do mightily, and will surely prevail.” So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">27</span><span class="verse">1</span> David said in his heart, “I will now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel. So shall I escape out of his hand.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Saul was told that David had fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> David said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, on the way to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> David struck the land, and saved no man or woman alive, and took away the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned, and came to Achish. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Achish said, “Against whom have you made a raid today?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">David said, “Against the South of Judah, against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, “Lest they should tell about us, saying, ‘David did this, and this has been his way all the time he has lived in the country of the Philistines.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Achish believed David, saying, “He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him. Therefore he will be my servant forever.” </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">35</span> Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> For David himself said in the Holy Spirit,</span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">‘The Lord said to my Lord,</span> <span class="line">“Sit at my right hand,</span> <span class="line">until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.” ’</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The common people heard him gladly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> In his teaching he said to them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> and the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts: </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> those who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> A poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> which equal a quadrans coin.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> He called his disciples to himself, and said to them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on.”</span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yes, I beg you that I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> For though we walk in the flesh, we don’t wage war according to the flesh;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience is made full.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that even as he is Christ’s, so we also are Christ’s.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For even if I boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down, I will not be ashamed,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For, “His letters”, they say, “are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.  </span>
