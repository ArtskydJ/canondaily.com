Sons were born to them after the flood. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh”.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon—as you go toward Gerar—to Gaza—as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> These are the sons of Ham, after their families, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Children were also born to Shem (the elder brother of Japheth), the father of all the children of Eber.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother’s name was Joktan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Obal, Abimael, Sheba,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> These are the sons of Shem, by their families, according to their languages, lands, and nations. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> These are the families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, according to their nations. The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> As they traveled from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh said, “Behold, they are one people, and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> This is the history of the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Haran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees, while his father Terah was still alive.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was also the father of Iscah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Sarai was barren. She had no child.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran. </span> </span>

In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He took him by the right hand and raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Leaping up, he stood and began to walk.

They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> As the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> When Peter saw it, he responded to the people, “You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know.
