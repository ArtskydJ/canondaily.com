		<span class="reference">Exodus 4-6</span>  <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> Moses answered, “But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, ‘Yahweh has not appeared to you.’ ”  <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh said to him, “What is that in your hand?”  He said, “A rod.”  <span class="verse">3</span> He said, “Throw it on the ground.”  He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it.  <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand, and take it by the tail.”  He stretched out his hand, and took hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand.  <span class="verse">5</span> “This is so that they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”   <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh said furthermore to him, “Now put your hand inside your cloak.”  He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.  <span class="verse">7</span> He said, “Put your hand inside your cloak again.”  He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh.  <span class="verse">8</span> “It will happen, if they will not believe you or listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.   <span class="verse">9</span> It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Moses said to Yahweh, “O Lord,  I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh said to him, “Who made man’s mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn’t it I, Yahweh?   <span class="verse">12</span> Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Moses said, “Oh, Lord, please send someone else.”  <span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh’s anger burned against Moses, and he said, “What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he is coming out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.   <span class="verse">15</span> You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.   <span class="verse">16</span> He will be your spokesman to the people. It will happen that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God.   <span class="verse">17</span> You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.”  <span class="verse">18</span> Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.”  Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”  <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return into Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead.”  <span class="verse">20</span> Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took God’s rod in his hand.   <span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.   <span class="verse">22</span> You shall tell Pharaoh, ‘Yahweh says, Israel is my son, my firstborn,   <span class="verse">23</span> and I have said to you, “Let my son go, that he may serve me;” and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your firstborn son.’ ”  <span class="verse">24</span> On the way at a lodging place, Yahweh met Moses and wanted to kill him.   <span class="verse">25</span> Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”  <span class="verse">26</span> So he let him alone. Then she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.  <span class="verse">27</span> Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.”  He went, and met him on God’s mountain, and kissed him.   <span class="verse">28</span> Moses told Aaron all Yahweh’s words with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had instructed him.   <span class="verse">29</span> Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse">30</span> Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.   <span class="verse">31</span> The people believed, and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.   <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, “This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.’ ”  <span class="verse">2</span> Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don’t know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go.”  <span class="verse">3</span> They said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.”  <span class="verse">4</span> The king of Egypt said to them, “Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!”   <span class="verse">5</span> Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens.”   <span class="verse">6</span> The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,   <span class="verse">7</span> “You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.   <span class="verse">8</span> You shall require from them the number of the bricks which they made before. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, saying, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to our God.’   <span class="verse">9</span> Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor in it. Don’t let them pay any attention to lying words.”  <span class="verse">10</span> The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you straw.   <span class="verse">11</span> Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.’ ”   <span class="verse">12</span> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.   <span class="verse">13</span> The taskmasters were urgent saying, “Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!”   <span class="verse">14</span> The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, “Why haven’t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?”  <span class="verse">15</span> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants?   <span class="verse">16</span> No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, ‘Make brick!’ and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.”  <span class="verse">17</span> But Pharaoh said, “You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to Yahweh.’   <span class="verse">18</span> Go therefore now, and work; for no straw shall be given to you; yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!”  <span class="verse">19</span> The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble when it was said, “You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!”  <span class="verse">20</span> They met Moses and Aaron, who stood along the way, as they came out from Pharaoh.   <span class="verse">21</span> They said to them, “May Yahweh look at you and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us!”  <span class="verse">22</span> Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, “Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me?   <span class="verse">23</span> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people. You have not rescued your people at all!”   <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land.”  <span class="verse">2</span> God spoke to Moses, and said to him, “I am Yahweh.   <span class="verse">3</span> I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them.   <span class="verse">4</span> I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens.   <span class="verse">5</span> Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.   <span class="verse">6</span> Therefore tell the children of Israel, ‘I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments.   <span class="verse">7</span> I will take you to myself for a people. I will be your God; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.   <span class="verse">8</span> I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am Yahweh.’ ”  <span class="verse">9</span> Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn’t listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.  <span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">11</span> “Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.”  <span class="verse">12</span> Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, “Behold, the children of Israel haven’t listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, when I have uncircumcised lips?”   <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a command to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse">14</span> These are the heads of their fathers’ houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.   <span class="verse">15</span> The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.   <span class="verse">16</span> These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty-seven years.   <span class="verse">17</span> The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families.   <span class="verse">18</span> The sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty-three years.   <span class="verse">19</span> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.   <span class="verse">20</span> Amram took Jochebed his father’s sister to himself as wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. The years of the life of Amram were one hundred thirty-seven years.   <span class="verse">21</span> The sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.   <span class="verse">22</span> The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.   <span class="verse">23</span> Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, as his wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.   <span class="verse">24</span> The sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.   <span class="verse">25</span> Eleazar Aaron’s son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites according to their families.   <span class="verse">26</span> These are that Aaron and Moses to whom Yahweh said, “Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.”   <span class="verse">27</span> These are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron.  <span class="verse">28</span> On the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,   <span class="verse">29</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “I am Yahweh. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I tell you.”  <span class="verse">30</span> Moses said before Yahweh, “Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh listen to me?”

		<span class="reference">Matthew 11:1-19</span>  <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.   <span class="verse">2</span> Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples   <span class="verse">3</span> and said to him, “Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?”  <span class="verse">4</span> Jesus answered them,  “Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:  <span class="verse">5</span> the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. <span class="verse">6</span> Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.” <span class="verse">7</span> As these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John,  “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?  <span class="verse">8</span> But what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses.  <span class="verse">9</span> But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.  <span class="verse">10</span> For this is he, of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’ <span class="verse">11</span> Most certainly I tell you, among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.  <span class="verse">12</span> From the days of John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. <span class="verse">13</span> For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.  <span class="verse">14</span> If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.  <span class="verse">15</span> He who has ears to hear, let him hear. <span class="verse">16</span> “But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions  <span class="verse">17</span> and say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned for you, and you didn’t lament.’  <span class="verse">18</span> For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’  <span class="verse">19</span> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her children.”

There was a man of Macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, “Come over into Macedonia and help us.”   <span class="verse">10</span> When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Good News to them.   <span class="verse">11</span> Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;   <span class="verse">12</span> and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city.  <span class="verse">13</span> On the Sabbath day we went outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.   <span class="verse">14</span> A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us. The Lord opened her heart to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul.   <span class="verse">15</span> When she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.” So she persuaded us.
