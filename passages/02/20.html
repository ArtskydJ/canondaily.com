		<span class="reference">Leviticus 8-10</span>  <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;   <span class="verse">3</span> and assemble all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting.   <span class="verse">5</span> Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded to be done.”   <span class="verse">6</span> Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.   <span class="verse">7</span> He put the tunic on him, tied the sash on him, clothed him with the robe, put the ephod on him, and he tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod on him and fastened it to him with it.   <span class="verse">8</span> He placed the breastplate on him. He put the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate.   <span class="verse">9</span> He set the turban on his head. He set the golden plate, the holy crown, on the front of the turban, as Yahweh commanded Moses.   <span class="verse">10</span> Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them.   <span class="verse">11</span> He sprinkled it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the basin and its base, to sanctify them.   <span class="verse">12</span> He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.   <span class="verse">13</span> Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, and tied sashes on them, and put headbands on them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <span class="verse">14</span> He brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.   <span class="verse">15</span> He killed it; and Moses took the blood, and put it around on the horns of the altar with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.   <span class="verse">16</span> He took all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it on the altar.   <span class="verse">17</span> But the bull, and its skin, and its meat, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as Yahweh commanded Moses.   <span class="verse">18</span> He presented the ram of the burnt offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.   <span class="verse">19</span> He killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar.   <span class="verse">20</span> He cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burned the head, and the pieces, and the fat.   <span class="verse">21</span> He washed the innards and the legs with water; and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.   <span class="verse">22</span> He presented the other ram, the ram of consecration. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.   <span class="verse">23</span> He killed it; and Moses took some of its blood, and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.   <span class="verse">24</span> He brought Aaron’s sons; and Moses put some of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar.   <span class="verse">25</span> He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that was on the innards, the cover of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh;   <span class="verse">26</span> and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before Yahweh, he took one unleavened cake, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat and on the right thigh.   <span class="verse">27</span> He put all these in Aaron’s hands and in his sons’ hands, and waved them for a wave offering before Yahweh.   <span class="verse">28</span> Moses took them from their hands, and burned them on the altar on the burnt offering. They were a consecration offering for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">29</span> Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before Yahweh. It was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration, as Yahweh commanded Moses.   <span class="verse">30</span> Moses took some of the anointing oil, and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.  <span class="verse">31</span> Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’   <span class="verse">32</span> What remains of the meat and of the bread you shall burn with fire.   <span class="verse">33</span> You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your consecration are fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.   <span class="verse">34</span> What has been done today, so Yahweh has commanded to do, to make atonement for you.   <span class="verse">35</span> You shall stay at the door of the Tent of Meeting day and night seven days, and keep Yahweh’s command, that you don’t die: for so I am commanded.”   <span class="verse">36</span> Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh commanded by Moses.   <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;   <span class="verse">2</span> and he said to Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without defect, and offer them before Yahweh.   <span class="verse">3</span> You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without defect, for a burnt offering;   <span class="verse">4</span> and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today Yahweh appears to you.’ ”  <span class="verse">5</span> They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting. All the congregation came near and stood before Yahweh.   <span class="verse">6</span> Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do; and Yahweh’s glory shall appear to you.”   <span class="verse">7</span> Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Yahweh commanded.”  <span class="verse">8</span> So Aaron came near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.   <span class="verse">9</span> The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar;   <span class="verse">10</span> but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar, as Yahweh commanded Moses.   <span class="verse">11</span> The meat and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.   <span class="verse">12</span> He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.   <span class="verse">13</span> They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head. He burned them upon the altar.   <span class="verse">14</span> He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.   <span class="verse">15</span> He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first.   <span class="verse">16</span> He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.   <span class="verse">17</span> He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.   <span class="verse">18</span> He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people. Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar;   <span class="verse">19</span> and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver;   <span class="verse">20</span> and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar.   <span class="verse">21</span> Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh for a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.   <span class="verse">22</span> Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.  <span class="verse">23</span> Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the people.   <span class="verse">24</span> Fire came out from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.   <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before Yahweh, which he had not commanded them.   <span class="verse">2</span> Fire came out from before Yahweh, and devoured them, and they died before Yahweh.  <span class="verse">3</span> Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what Yahweh spoke of, saying,  ‘I will show myself holy to those who come near me,  and before all the people I will be glorified.’ ”  Aaron held his peace.   <span class="verse">4</span> Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Draw near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.”   <span class="verse">5</span> So they came near, and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said.  <span class="verse">6</span> Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Don’t let the hair of your heads go loose, and don’t tear your clothes, so that you don’t die, and so that he will not be angry with all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh has kindled.   <span class="verse">7</span> You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you.” They did according to the word of Moses.   <span class="verse">8</span> Then Yahweh said to Aaron,   <span class="verse">9</span> “You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink whenever you go into the Tent of Meeting, or you will die. This shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.   <span class="verse">10</span> You are to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean.   <span class="verse">11</span> You are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh has spoken to them by Moses.”  <span class="verse">12</span> Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, “Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy;   <span class="verse">13</span> and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons’ portion, of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire; for so I am commanded.   <span class="verse">14</span> The waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your portion, and your sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse">15</span> The heaved thigh and the waved breast they shall bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before Yahweh. It shall be yours, and your sons’ with you, as a portion forever, as Yahweh has commanded.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and, behold,  it was burned. He was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,   <span class="verse">17</span> “Why haven’t you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is most holy, and he has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh?   <span class="verse">18</span> Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.”  <span class="verse">19</span> Aaron spoke to Moses, “Behold, today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh; and such things as these have happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in Yahweh’s sight?”  <span class="verse">20</span> When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his sight.

		<span class="reference">Psalms 40</span>  <span class="chapter">40</span><span class="verse">1</span> I waited patiently for Yahweh.  He turned to me, and heard my cry.  <span class="verse">2</span> He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,  out of the miry clay.  He set my feet on a rock,  and gave me a firm place to stand.  <span class="verse">3</span> He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.  Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.  <span class="verse">4</span> Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust,  and doesn’t respect the proud, nor such as turn away to lies.  <span class="verse">5</span> Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done,  and your thoughts which are toward us.  They can’t be declared back to you.  If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be counted.  <span class="verse">6</span> Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire.  You have opened my ears.  You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.  <span class="verse">7</span> Then I said, “Behold, I have come.  It is written about me in the book in the scroll.  <span class="verse">8</span> I delight to do your will, my God.  Yes, your law is within my heart.”  <span class="verse">9</span> I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly.  Behold, I will not seal my lips, Yahweh, you know.  <span class="verse">10</span> I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.  I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.  I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly.  <span class="verse">11</span> Don’t withhold your tender mercies from me, Yahweh.  Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.  <span class="verse">12</span> For innumerable evils have surrounded me.  My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.  They are more than the hairs of my head.  My heart has failed me.  <span class="verse">13</span> Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me.  Hurry to help me, Yahweh.  <span class="verse">14</span> Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it.  Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.  <span class="verse">15</span> Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, “Aha! Aha!”  <span class="verse">16</span> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.  Let such as love your salvation say continually, “Let Yahweh be exalted!”  <span class="verse">17</span> But I am poor and needy.  May the Lord think about me.  You are my help and my deliverer.  Don’t delay, my God.

For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!  <span class="verse">8</span> If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.  <span class="verse">9</span> If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire.

I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well.   <span class="verse">11</span> For if I have done wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I don’t refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!”  <span class="verse">12</span> Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you shall go.”
