But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and there were precious stones in it. It was set on David’s head, and he brought very much plunder out of the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He brought out the people who were in it, and had them cut with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> After this, war arose at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Again there was war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother killed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">1</span> Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to take a census of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know how many there are.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Joab said, “May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, then came to Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Joab gave up the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But he didn’t count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> So Gad came to David, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Take your choice:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and Yahweh’s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into Yahweh’s hand; for his mercies are very great. Don’t let me fall into man’s hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> David lifted up his eyes, and saw Yahweh’s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> David said to God, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then Yahweh’s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in Yahweh’s name. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Then David said to Ornan, “Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> King David said to Ornan, “No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of gold by weight for the place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Then Yahweh commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> For Yahweh’s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> But David couldn’t go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of Yahweh’s angel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">22</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then David said, “This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut dressed stones to build God’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and bronze in abundance without weight;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> and cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the people of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David prepared abundantly before his death.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> David said to Solomon his son, “As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ‘You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He shall build a house for my name; and he will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken concerning you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid, and don’t be dismayed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for Yahweh’s house one hundred thousand talents</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of gold, one million talents</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of silver, and bronze and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> of the gold, the silver, the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yahweh be with you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> “Isn’t Yahweh your God with you? Hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh, and before his people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Now set your heart and your soul to follow Yahweh your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for Yahweh’s name.” </span> </span>
