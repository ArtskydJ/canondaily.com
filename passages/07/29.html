Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of Yahweh’s camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He also appointed the king’s portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in Yahweh’s law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to Yahweh’s law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> As soon as the commandment went out, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and of all the increase of the field; and they brought in the tithe of all things abundantly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God, and laid them in heaps. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh and his people Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, “Since people began to bring the offerings into Yahweh’s house, we have eaten and had enough, and have plenty left over, for Yahweh has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in Yahweh’s house, and they prepared them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated things faithfully. Conaniah the Levite was ruler over them, and Shimei his brother was second.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of God’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east gate, was over the free will offerings of God, to distribute Yahweh’s offerings and the most holy things.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Under him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions, to the great as well as to the small;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> in addition to those who were listed by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into Yahweh’s house, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their divisions;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> and those who were listed by genealogy of the priests by their fathers’ houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> and those who were listed by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation; for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the pasture lands of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all who were listed by genealogy among the Levites. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Hezekiah did so throughout all Judah; and he did that which was good, right, and faithful before Yahweh his God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> In every work that he began in the service of God’s house, in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">32</span><span class="verse">1</span> After these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and intended to win them for himself.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he was planning to fight against Jerusalem,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city, and they helped him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> So, many people gathered together and they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the middle of the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find abundant water?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He took courage, built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, with the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo in David’s city, and made weapons and shields in abundance.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the wide place at the gate of the city, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or dismayed because of the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude who is with him; for there is a greater one with us than with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> An arm of flesh is with him, but Yahweh our God is with us to help us and to fight our battles.” The people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Sennacherib king of Assyria says, “In whom do you trust, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Doesn’t Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, ‘Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Hasn’t the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You shall worship before one altar, and you shall burn incense on it?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Don’t you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Now therefore don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this way. Don’t believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> His servants spoke yet more against Yahweh God, and against his servant Hezekiah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He also wrote letters insulting Yahweh, the God of Israel, and speaking against him, saying, “As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> They called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men’s hands. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. When he had come into the house of his god, those who came out of his own body</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> killed him there with the sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from then on. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> In those days Hezekiah was terminally ill, and he prayed to Yahweh; and he spoke to him, and gave him a sign.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> But Hezekiah didn’t reciprocate appropriate to the benefit done for him, because his heart was lifted up. Therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that Yahweh’s wrath didn’t come on them in the days of Hezekiah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Hezekiah had exceedingly much riches and honor. He provided himself with treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of valuable vessels;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> also storehouses for the increase of grain, new wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of animals, and flocks in folds.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Moreover he provided for himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him abundant possessions.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of David’s city. Hezekiah prospered in all his works. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> However concerning the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his place. </span> </span>
