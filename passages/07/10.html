Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, the pillars, and the vessels of bronze. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and bronze.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, from Moab, from the children of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amalek.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness for all his people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; Shavsha was scribe;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief officials serving the king. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">19</span><span class="verse">1</span> After this, Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven’t his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then some people went and told David how the men were treated. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah with his people, who came and encamped near Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> When David heard of it, he sent Joab with all the army of the mighty men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose some of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Be courageous, and let’s be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May Yahweh do that which seems good to him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the front of the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and called out the Syrians who were beyond the River,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer leading them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> David was told that; so he gathered all Israel together, passed over the Jordan, came to them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrian men seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and also killed Shophach the captain of the army.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and served him. The Syrians would not help the children of Ammon any more. </span> </span>
