But David stayed at Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> At evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king’s house. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look at.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, Uriah the Hittite’s wife?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, “I am with child.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> David sent to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” Joab sent Uriah to David.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> When Uriah had come to him, David asked him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn’t go down to his house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> When they had told David, saying, “Uriah didn’t go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Haven’t you come from a journey? Why didn’t you go down to your house?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Uriah said to David, “The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn’t go down to his house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He wrote in the letter, saying, “Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When Joab kept watch on the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of David’s servants; and Uriah the Hittite died also.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> and he commanded the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he asks you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn’t you know that they would shoot from the wall?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn’t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Then David said to the messenger, “Tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.’ Encourage him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> When Uriah’s wife heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The rich man had very many flocks and herds,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was like a daughter to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to prepare for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and prepared it for the man who had come to him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> David’s anger burned hot against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this deserves to die!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He must restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Nathan said to David, “You are the man. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Why have you despised Yahweh’s word, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken Uriah the Hittite’s wife to be your wife.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “This is what Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> For you did this secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Nathan said to David, “Yahweh also has put away your sin. You will not die.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh’s enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you will surely die.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Nathan departed to his house. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Yahweh struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it was very sick.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, and he didn’t eat bread with them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> On the seventh day, the child died. David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he didn’t listen to our voice. How will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said, “He is dead.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and he came into Yahweh’s house, and worshiped. Then he came to his own house; and when he requested, they set bread before him, and he ate.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then his servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> He said, “While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Yahweh loved him;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> for Yahweh’s sake. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of waters.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called by my name.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. He brought a great quantity of plunder out of the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> He brought out the people who were in it, and put them under saws, under iron picks, under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln; and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. </span> </span>
