		<span class="reference">Ezra 5</span>  <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem. They prophesied to them in the name of the God of Israel.   <span class="verse">2</span> Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build God’s house which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.   <span class="verse">3</span> At the same time Tattenai, the governor beyond the River came to them, with Shetharbozenai, and their companions, and asked them, “Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?”   <span class="verse">4</span> They also asked for the names of the men were who were making this building.   <span class="verse">5</span> But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they didn’t make them cease, until the matter should come to Darius, and an answer should be returned by letter concerning it.  <span class="verse">6</span> The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shetharbozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king follows.   <span class="verse">7</span> They sent a letter to him, in which was written:  To Darius the king, all peace.  <span class="verse">8</span> Be it known to the king that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls. This work goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands.   <span class="verse">9</span> Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, “Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?”   <span class="verse">10</span> We asked them their names also, to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head.   <span class="verse">11</span> Thus they returned us answer, saying, “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.   <span class="verse">12</span> But after our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.   <span class="verse">13</span> But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.   <span class="verse">14</span> The gold and silver vessels of God’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those Cyrus the king also took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor.   <span class="verse">15</span> He said to him, ‘Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let God’s house be built in its place.’   <span class="verse">16</span> Then the same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of God’s house which is in Jerusalem. Since that time even until now it has been being built, and yet it is not completed.  <span class="verse">17</span> Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the king’s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.”

By understanding, he established the heavens.  <span class="verse">20</span> By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,  and the skies drop down the dew.  <span class="verse">21</span> My son, let them not depart from your eyes.  Keep sound wisdom and discretion:  <span class="verse">22</span> so they will be life to your soul,  and grace for your neck.  <span class="verse">23</span> Then you shall walk in your way securely.  Your foot won’t stumble.  <span class="verse">24</span> When you lie down, you will not be afraid.  Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.  <span class="verse">25</span> Don’t be afraid of sudden fear,  neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes;  <span class="verse">26</span> for Yahweh will be your confidence,  and will keep your foot from being taken.  <span class="verse">27</span> Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due,  when it is in the power of your hand to do it.  <span class="verse">28</span> Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again;  tomorrow I will give it to you,”  when you have it by you.  <span class="verse">29</span> Don’t devise evil against your neighbor,  since he dwells securely by you.  <span class="verse">30</span> Don’t strive with a man without cause,  if he has done you no harm.  <span class="verse">31</span> Don’t envy the man of violence.  Choose none of his ways.  <span class="verse">32</span> For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh,  but his friendship is with the upright.  <span class="verse">33</span> Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked,  but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.  <span class="verse">34</span> Surely he mocks the mockers,  but he gives grace to the humble.  <span class="verse">35</span> The wise will inherit glory,  but shame will be the promotion of fools.

He took him, and healed him, and let him go.   <span class="verse">5</span> He answered them,  “Which of you, if your son or an ox fell into a well, wouldn’t immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?” <span class="verse">6</span> They couldn’t answer him regarding these things.

		<span class="reference">1 Timothy 3:1-10</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> This is a faithful saying: someone who seeks to be an overseer  desires a good work.   <span class="verse">2</span> The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;   <span class="verse">3</span> not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;   <span class="verse">4</span> one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;   <span class="verse">5</span> (but how could someone who doesn’t know how to rule one’s own house take care of God’s assembly?)   <span class="verse">6</span> not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.   <span class="verse">7</span> Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil.  <span class="verse">8</span> Servants,  in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money,   <span class="verse">9</span> holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.   <span class="verse">10</span> Let them also first be tested; then let them serve  if they are blameless.
