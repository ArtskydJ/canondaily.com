You are to pass over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, “Who can stand before the sons of Anak?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Know therefore today that Yahweh your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire. He will destroy them and he will bring them down before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Don’t say in your heart, after Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you, “For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;” because Yahweh drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Know therefore that Yahweh your God doesn’t give you this good land to possess for your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Remember, and don’t forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you left the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When I had gone up onto the mountain to receive the stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh delivered to me the two stone tablets written with God’s finger. On them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh said to me, “Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned away from the way which I commanded them. They have made a molten image for themselves!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God. You had made yourselves a molded calf. You had quickly turned away from the way which Yahweh had commanded you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Yahweh to wrath.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you,” you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn’t believe him or listen to his voice.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> I prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, don’t destroy your people and your inheritance that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t look at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> At that time Yahweh said to me, “Cut two stone tablets like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly; and Yahweh gave them to me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God spoke to him.) </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights; and Yahweh listened to me that time also. Yahweh would not destroy you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh said to me, “Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> to keep Yahweh’s commandments and statutes, which I command you today for your good?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Behold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven, the heaven of heavens, and the earth, with all that is therein.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their offspring after them, even you above all peoples, as it is today.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> For Yahweh your God, he is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn’t respect persons or take bribes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He executes justice for the fatherless and widow and loves the foreigner in giving him food and clothing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore love the foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> You shall fear Yahweh your God. You shall serve him. You shall cling to him, and you shall swear by his name.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things which your eyes have seen.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his instructions, his statutes, his ordinances, and his commandments, always.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Know this day—for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> his signs, and his works, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> and what he did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben—how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the middle of all Israel;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> but your eyes have seen all of Yahweh’s great work which he did. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Therefore you shall keep the entire commandment which I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land that you go over to possess;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> and that you may prolong your days in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For the land, where you go in to possess isn’t like the land of Egypt that you came out of, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> but the land that you go over to possess is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water from the rain of the sky,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> a land which Yahweh your God cares for. Yahweh your God’s eyes are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you today, to love Yahweh your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> that I will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn away to serve other gods and worship them;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> and Yahweh’s anger be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky so that there is no rain, and the land doesn’t yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul. You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> You shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> that your days and your children’s days may be multiplied in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you—to do them, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him—  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> then Yahweh will drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the western sea shall be your border.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> No man will be able to stand before you. Yahweh your God will lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you tread on, as he has spoken to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I command you today;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn away out of the way which I command you today, to go after other gods which you have not known.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> It shall happen, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land that you go to possess, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Aren’t they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah near Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and you shall possess it and dwell in it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you today. </span> </span>
