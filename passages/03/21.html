You shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> You shall not make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For that would turn away your sons from following me, that they may serve other gods. So Yahweh’s anger would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> But you shall deal with them like this: you shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their engraved images with fire.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God. Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh didn’t set his love on you nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> but because Yahweh loves you, and because he desires to keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, Yahweh has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Know therefore that Yahweh your God himself is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack to him who hates him. He will repay him to his face.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> You shall therefore keep the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances which I command you today, to do them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances and keep and do them, that Yahweh your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to your fathers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> You will be blessed above all peoples. There won’t be male or female barren among you, or among your livestock.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and he will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you. Your eye shall not pity them. You shall not serve their gods; for that would be a snare to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> If you shall say in your heart, “These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> you shall not be afraid of them. You shall remember well what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your God brought you out. So shall Yahweh your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is among you, a great and awesome God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you little by little. You may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they are destroyed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under the sky. No one will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> You shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> You shall not bring an abomination into your house and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it. You shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> You shall observe to do all the commandments which I command you today, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to test you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He humbled you, allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna, which you didn’t know, neither did your fathers know, that he might teach you that man does not live by bread only, but man lives by every word that proceeds out of Yahweh’s mouth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Your clothing didn’t grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> You shall consider in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so Yahweh your God disciplines you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing into valleys and hills;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> a land in which you shall eat bread without scarcity, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Yahweh your God for the good land which he has given you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Beware lest you forget Yahweh your God, in not keeping his commandments, his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command you today;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built fine houses and lived in them;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> then your heart might be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with venomous snakes and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who poured water for you out of the rock of flint;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn’t know, that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> and lest you say in your heart, “My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But you shall remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is today. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you shall surely perish.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you, so you shall perish, because you wouldn’t listen to Yahweh your God’s voice. </span> </span>

Stay here, and watch with me.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour? </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> Watch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.” </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">46</span> Arise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">47</span> While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">48</span> Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one.

May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> You will say then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> for if God didn’t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? </span> </span>
