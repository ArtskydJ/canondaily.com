		<span class="header">Numbers 21-22</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">1</span> The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard that Israel came by the way of Atharim. He fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. The name of the place was called Hormah.</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. The soul of the people was very discouraged because of the journey.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The people spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, there is no water, and our soul loathes this disgusting food!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh sent venomous snakes among the people, and they bit the people. Many people of Israel died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, because we have spoken against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents from us.” Moses prayed for the people. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Make a venomous snake, and set it on a pole. It shall happen that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Moses made a serpent of bronze, and set it on the pole. If a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked at the serpent of bronze, he lived. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Yahweh, “Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> From there they traveled to Beer; that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then Israel sang this song: </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Spring up, well! Sing to it, </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">18</span> the well, which the princes dug, </span> <span class="line">which the nobles of the people dug, </span> <span class="line">with the scepter, and with their poles.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> “Let me pass through your land. We will not turn away into field or vineyard. We will not drink of the water of the wells. We will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed your border.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was fortified.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Israel took all these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Come to Heshbon. </span> <span class="line">Let the city of Sihon be built and established; </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">28</span> for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, </span> <span class="line">a flame from the city of Sihon. </span> <span class="line">It has devoured Ar of Moab, </span> <span class="line">The lords of the high places of the Arnon. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">29</span> Woe to you, Moab! </span> <span class="line">You are undone, people of Chemosh! </span> <span class="line">He has given his sons as fugitives, </span> <span class="line">and his daughters into captivity, </span> <span class="line">to Sihon king of the Amorites. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">30</span> We have shot at them. </span> <span class="line">Heshbon has perished even to Dibon. </span> <span class="line">We have laid waste even to Nophah, </span> <span class="line">Which reaches to Medeba.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Moses sent to spy out Jazer. They took its villages, and drove out the Amorites who were there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> They turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Don’t fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people, and his land. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> So they struck him, with his sons and all his people, until there were no survivors; and they possessed his land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">22</span><span class="verse">1</span> The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many. Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Please come now therefore, and curse this people for me; for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand. They came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me.” The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> God came to Balaam, and said, “Who are these men with you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> ‘Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt covers the surface of the earth. Now, come curse me them. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Balak again sent princes, more, and more honorable than they.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> They came to Balaam, and said to him, “Balak the son of Zippor says, ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Balaam answered the servants of Balak, “If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Now therefore please stay here tonight as well, that I may know what else Yahweh will speak to me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> God’s anger burned because he went; and Yahweh’s angel placed himself in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned out of the path, and went into the field. Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the path.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Then Yahweh’s angel stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. He struck her again. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Yahweh’s angel went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she lay down under Balaam. Balaam’s anger burned, and he struck the donkey with his staff. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long until today? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “No.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> The donkey saw me, and turned away before me these three times. Unless she had turned away from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Balaam said to Yahweh’s angel, “I have sinned; for I didn’t know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> Yahweh’s angel said to Balaam, “Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I earnestly send for you to summon you? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you. Have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> In the morning, Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there part of the people. </span> </span>
