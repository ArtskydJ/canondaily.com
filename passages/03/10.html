The congregation and their livestock drank. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you didn’t believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> These are the waters of Meribah;</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> because the children of Israel strove with Yahweh, and he was sanctified in them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“Your brother Israel says: You know all the travail that has happened to us;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time.

Behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the edge of your border. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> “Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink from the water of the wells. We will go along the king’s highway.

Only let me, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He said, “You shall not pass through.” Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel turned away from him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> They traveled from Kadesh, and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> “Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron shall be gathered, and shall die there.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Moses did as Yahweh commanded. They went up onto Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there on the top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. </span> </span>
