		<span class="reference">Zechariah 11-12</span>  <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> Open your doors, Lebanon,  that the fire may devour your cedars.  <span class="verse">2</span> Wail, cypress tree, for the cedar has fallen,  because the stately ones are destroyed.  Wail, you oaks of Bashan,  for the strong forest has come down.  <span class="verse">3</span> A voice of the wailing of the shepherds!  For their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions!  For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.  <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh my God says: “Feed the flock of slaughter.   <span class="verse">5</span> Their buyers slaughter them, and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be Yahweh, for I am rich;’ and their own shepherds don’t pity them.   <span class="verse">6</span> For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land,” says Yahweh; “but, behold, I will deliver the men everyone into his neighbor’s hand, and into the hand of his king. They will strike the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.”  <span class="verse">7</span> So I fed the flock of slaughter, especially the oppressed of the flock. I took for myself two staffs. The one I called “Favor”, and the other I called “Union”, and I fed the flock.   <span class="verse">8</span> I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.   <span class="verse">9</span> Then I said, “I will not feed you. That which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let those who are left eat each other’s flesh.”   <span class="verse">10</span> I took my staff Favor, and cut it apart, that I might break my covenant that I had made with all the peoples.   <span class="verse">11</span> It was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that listened to me knew that it was Yahweh’s word.   <span class="verse">12</span> I said to them, “If you think it best, give me my wages; and if not, keep them.” So they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver.   <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh said to me, “Throw it to the potter, the handsome price that I was valued at by them!” I took the thirty pieces of silver, and threw them to the potter, in Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">14</span> Then I cut apart my other staff, even Union, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.  <span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh said to me, “Take for yourself yet again the equipment of a foolish shepherd.   <span class="verse">16</span> For, behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are cut off, neither will seek those who are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the meat of the fat sheep, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.   <span class="verse">17</span> Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock! The sword will be on his arm, and on his right eye. His arm will be completely withered, and his right eye will be totally blinded!”   <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> A revelation, Yahweh’s word concerning Israel. Yahweh, who stretches out the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him says:   <span class="verse">2</span> “Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the surrounding peoples, and it will also be on Judah in the siege against Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">3</span> It will happen in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples. All who burden themselves with it will be severely wounded, and all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it.   <span class="verse">4</span> In that day,” says Yahweh, “I will strike every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open my eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.   <span class="verse">5</span> The chieftains of Judah will say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahweh of Armies their God.’   <span class="verse">6</span> In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they will devour all the surrounding peoples, on the right hand and on the left; and Jerusalem will yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh also will save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of David’s house and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem not be magnified above Judah.   <span class="verse">8</span> In that day Yahweh will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem. He who is feeble among them at that day will be like David, and David’s house will be like God, like Yahweh’s angel before them.   <span class="verse">9</span> It will happen in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">10</span> I will pour on David’s house, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they will look to me  whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and will grieve bitterly for him, as one grieves for his firstborn.   <span class="verse">11</span> In that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.   <span class="verse">12</span> The land will mourn, every family apart; the family of David’s house apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;   <span class="verse">13</span> the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;   <span class="verse">14</span> all the families who remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.

Or will you bind him for your girls?  <span class="verse">6</span> Will traders barter for him?  Will they part him among the merchants?  <span class="verse">7</span> Can you fill his skin with barbed irons,  or his head with fish spears?  <span class="verse">8</span> Lay your hand on him.  Remember the battle, and do so no more.  <span class="verse">9</span> Behold, the hope of him is in vain.  Won’t one be cast down even at the sight of him?  <span class="verse">10</span> None is so fierce that he dare stir him up.  Who then is he who can stand before me?  <span class="verse">11</span> Who has first given to me, that I should repay him?  Everything under the heavens is mine.

		<span class="reference">John 21:1-6</span>  <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">1</span> After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way.   <span class="verse">2</span> Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.   <span class="verse">3</span> Simon Peter said to them, “I’m going fishing.”  They told him, “We are also coming with you.” They immediately went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.   <span class="verse">4</span> But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn’t know that it was Jesus.   <span class="verse">5</span> Jesus therefore said to them,  “Children, have you anything to eat?”  They answered him, “No.”  <span class="verse">6</span> He said to them,  “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” They cast it therefore, and now they weren’t able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.

		<span class="reference">Revelation 20</span>  <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.   <span class="verse">2</span> He seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole inhabited earth, and bound him for a thousand years,   <span class="verse">3</span> and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were finished. After this, he must be freed for a short time.   <span class="verse">4</span> I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as didn’t worship the beast nor his image, and didn’t receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand. They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.   <span class="verse">5</span> The rest of the dead didn’t live until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.   <span class="verse">6</span> Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over these, the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him one thousand years.  <span class="verse">7</span> And after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his prison,   <span class="verse">8</span> and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.   <span class="verse">9</span> They went up over the width of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city. Fire came down out of heaven from God and devoured them.   <span class="verse">10</span> The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.  <span class="verse">11</span> I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. There was found no place for them.   <span class="verse">12</span> I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and they opened books. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.   <span class="verse">13</span> The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades  gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one according to his works.   <span class="verse">14</span> Death and Hades  were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.   <span class="verse">15</span> If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
