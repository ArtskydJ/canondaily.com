		<span class="header">Isaiah 24-26</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> For it will be so within the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of Yahweh. They cry aloud from the sea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous! </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">But I said, “I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!” The treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabit the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> It will happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> They will be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and will be shut up in the prison; and after many days they will be visited.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and glory will be before his elders. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">25</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh, you are my God. I will exalt you! I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago, in complete faithfulness and truth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city. It will never be built.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore a strong people will glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> As the heat in a dry place you will bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> In this mountain, Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of choice meat,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> a feast of choice wines, of choice meat full of marrow, of well refined choice wines.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He has swallowed up death forever! The Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces. He will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth, for Yahweh has spoken it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> It shall be said in that day, “Behold, this is our God! We have waited for him, and he will save us! This is Yahweh! We have waited for him. We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For Yahweh’s hand will rest in this mountain. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Moab will be trodden down in his place, even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He will spread out his hands in the middle of it, like one who swims spreads out hands to swim, but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">26</span><span class="verse">1</span> In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah: </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“We have a strong city. </span> <span class="line">God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter: </span> <span class="line">the one which keeps faith. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> You will keep whoever’s mind is steadfast in perfect peace, </span> <span class="line">because he trusts in you. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> Trust in Yahweh forever; </span> <span class="line">for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city. </span> <span class="line">He lays it low. </span> <span class="line">He lays it low even to the ground. </span> <span class="line">He brings it even to the dust. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> The foot shall tread it down, </span> <span class="line">even the feet of the poor </span> <span class="line">and the steps of the needy.” </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> The way of the just is uprightness. </span> <span class="line">You who are upright make the path of the righteous level. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, we have waited for you. </span> <span class="line">Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> With my soul I have desired you in the night. </span> <span class="line">Yes, with my spirit within me I will seek you earnestly; </span> <span class="line">for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> Let favor be shown to the wicked, </span> <span class="line">yet he will not learn righteousness. </span> <span class="line">In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, </span> <span class="line">and will not see Yahweh’s majesty. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don’t see; </span> <span class="line">but they will see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed. </span> <span class="line">Yes, fire will consume your adversaries. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us, </span> <span class="line">for you have also done all our work for us. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us, </span> <span class="line">but we will only acknowledge your name. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> The dead shall not live. </span> <span class="line">The departed spirits shall not rise. </span> <span class="line">Therefore you have visited and destroyed them, </span> <span class="line">and caused all memory of them to perish. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">15</span> You have increased the nation, O Yahweh. </span> <span class="line">You have increased the nation!
