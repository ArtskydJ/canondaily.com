		<span class="stanza"> <span class="line"> <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse, </span> <span class="line">and a branch out of his roots will bear fruit. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh’s Spirit will rest on him: </span> <span class="line">the spirit of wisdom and understanding, </span> <span class="line">the spirit of counsel and might, </span> <span class="line">the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> His delight will be in the fear of Yahweh. </span> <span class="line">He will not judge by the sight of his eyes, </span> <span class="line">neither decide by the hearing of his ears; </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> but he will judge the poor with righteousness, </span> <span class="line">and decide with equity for the humble of the earth. </span> <span class="line">He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; </span> <span class="line">and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> Righteousness will be the belt of his waist, </span> <span class="line">and faithfulness the belt of his waist. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> The wolf will live with the lamb, </span> <span class="line">and the leopard will lie down with the young goat, </span> <span class="line">the calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf together; </span> <span class="line">and a little child will lead them. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> The cow and the bear will graze. </span> <span class="line">Their young ones will lie down together. </span> <span class="line">The lion will eat straw like the ox. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> The nursing child will play near a cobra’s hole, </span> <span class="line">and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper’s den. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; </span> <span class="line">for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh, </span> <span class="line">as the waters cover the sea. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> It will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse, who stands as a banner of the peoples; and his resting place will be glorious. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> It will happen in that day that the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who persecute Judah will be cut off. Ephraim won’t envy Judah, and Judah won’t persecute Ephraim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west. Together they will plunder the children of the east. They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon will obey them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River, and will split it into seven streams, and cause men to march over in sandals.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, like there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> In that day you will say, “I will give thanks to you, Yahweh; for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> In that day you will say, “Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Proclaim that his name is exalted!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One of Israel is great among you!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Set up a banner on the bare mountain! Lift up your voice to them! Wave your hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> I have commanded my consecrated ones; yes, I have called my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly exulting ones.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The noise of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people; the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Yahweh of Armies is mustering the army for the battle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even Yahweh, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Wail, for Yahweh’s day is at hand! It will come as destruction from the Almighty.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone’s heart will melt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They will be dismayed. Pangs and sorrows will seize them. They will be in pain like a woman in labor. They will look in amazement one at another. Their faces will be faces of flame.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Behold, the day of Yahweh comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation, and to destroy its sinners out of it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light. The sun will be darkened in its going out, and the moon will not cause its light to shine.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will humble the arrogance of the terrible.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> I will make people more rare than fine gold, even a person than the pure gold of Ophir.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place in Yahweh of Armies’ wrath, and in the day of his fierce anger.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> It will happen that like a hunted gazelle, and like sheep that no one gathers, they will each turn to their own people, and will each flee to their own land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Everyone who is found will be thrust through. Everyone who is captured will fall by the sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes. Their houses will be ransacked, and their wives raped. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not value silver, and as for gold, they will not delight in it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Their bows will dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb. Their eyes will not spare children.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans’ pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> It will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from generation to generation. The Arabian will not pitch a tent there, neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> But wild animals of the desert will lie there, and their houses will be full of jackals. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will frolic there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Wolves will cry in their fortresses, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come, and her days will not be prolonged. </span> </span>
