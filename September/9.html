When the trumpet is blown, listen! </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For Yahweh said to me, “I will be still, and I will see in my dwelling place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> They will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains, and for the animals of the earth. The ravenous birds will eat them in the summer, and all the animals of the earth will eat them in the winter.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> In that time, a present will be brought to Yahweh of Armies from a people tall and smooth, even from a people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Yahweh of Armies, Mount Zion. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">19</span><span class="verse">1</span> The burden of Egypt. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud, and comes to Egypt. The idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt will melt within it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they will fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The spirit of Egypt will fail within it. I will destroy its counsel. They will seek the idols, the charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king will rule over them,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The rivers will become foul. The streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The pillars will be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go astray, who are the cornerstone of her tribes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the middle of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers in his vomit.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of Yahweh of Armies’s hand, which he shakes over them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies, which he determines against it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of Armies. One will be called “The city of destruction.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> In that day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Yahweh at its border.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> It will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors, and he will send them a savior and a defender, and he will deliver them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day. Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow to Yahweh, and will perform it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing. They will return to Yahweh, and he will be entreated by them, and will heal them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing within the earth;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> at that time Yahweh spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and loosen the sackcloth from off your waist, and take your sandals from off your feet.” He did so, walking naked and barefoot.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh said, “As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day, ‘Behold, this is our expectation, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria. And we, how will we escape?’ ” </span> </span>
