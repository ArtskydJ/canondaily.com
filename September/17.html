		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">38</span><span class="verse">1</span> In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Set your house in order, for you will die, and not live.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and said, “Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to Isaiah, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> “Go, and tell Hezekiah, ‘Yahweh, the God of David your father, says, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.” ’ ” So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his sickness. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> I said, “In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.</span> <span class="line">I am deprived of the residue of my years.” </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> I said, “I won’t see Yah, </span> <span class="line">Yah in the land of the living. </span> <span class="line">I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> My dwelling is removed, </span> <span class="line">and is carried away from me like a shepherd’s tent. </span> <span class="line">I have rolled up my life like a weaver. </span> <span class="line">He will cut me off from the loom. </span> <span class="line">From day even to night you will make an end of me. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">13</span> I waited patiently until morning. </span> <span class="line">He breaks all my bones like a lion. </span> <span class="line">From day even to night you will make an end of me. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> I chattered like a swallow or a crane. </span> <span class="line">I moaned like a dove. </span> <span class="line">My eyes weaken looking upward. </span> <span class="line">Lord, I am oppressed. </span> <span class="line">Be my security.” </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">15</span> What will I say? </span> <span class="line">He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it. </span> <span class="line">I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">16</span> Lord, men live by these things; </span> <span class="line">and my spirit finds life in all of them: </span> <span class="line">you restore me, and cause me to live. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">17</span> Behold, for peace I had great anguish, </span> <span class="line">but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; </span> <span class="line">for you have cast all my sins behind your back. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">18</span> For Sheol</span> <span class="line"> can’t praise you. </span> <span class="line">Death can’t celebrate you. </span> <span class="line">Those who go down into the pit can’t hope for your truth. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">19</span> The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do today. </span> <span class="line">The father shall make known your truth to the children. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh will save me. </span> <span class="line">Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in Yahweh’s house. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to Yahweh’s house?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">39</span><span class="verse">1</span> At that time, Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Hezekiah said, “They have come from a country far from me, even from Babylon.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> ‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up until today, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> ‘They will take away your sons who will issue from you, whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon’s palace.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “Yahweh’s word which you have spoken is good.” He said moreover, “For there will be peace and truth in my days.” </span> </span>
