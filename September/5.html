A son is given to us; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, on David’s throne, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from that time on, even forever.

Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like Damascus?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore it will happen that when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the insolence of his arrogant looks.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> For he has said, “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding. I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, I have gathered all the earth. There was no one who moved their wing, or that opened their mouth, or chirped.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Should an ax brag against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body.

A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will make a full end, and that determined, throughout all the earth. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, says “My people who dwell in Zion, don’t be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strike you with the rod, and lift up his staff against you, as Egypt did.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> For yet a very little while, and the indignation against you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed to his destruction.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> It will happen in that day that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> He has come to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores his baggage.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul has fled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! You poor Anathoth!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror. The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One. </span> </span>
