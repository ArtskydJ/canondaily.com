		<span class="header">Isaiah 15-17</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">1</span> The burden of Moab. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">For in a night, Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing. For in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba. Baldness is on all of their heads. Every beard is cut off.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> In their streets, they clothe themselves in sackcloth. In their streets and on their housetops, everyone wails, weeping abundantly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Heshbon cries out with Elealeh. Their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud. Their souls tremble within them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> My heart cries out for Moab! Her nobles flee to Zoar, to Eglath Shelishiyah; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping; for on the way to Horonaim, they raise up a cry of destruction.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has withered away, the tender grass fails, there is no green thing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have stored up, over the brook of the willows.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab, its wailing to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more on Dimon, a lion on those of Moab who escape, and on the remnant of the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> Send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> For it will be that as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Give counsel! Execute justice! Make your shade like the night in the middle of the noonday! Hide the outcasts! Don’t betray the fugitive!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Let my outcasts dwell with you! As for Moab, be a hiding place for him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortionist is brought to nothing. Destruction ceases. The oppressors are consumed out of the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> A throne will be established in loving kindness. One will sit on it in truth, in the tent of David, judging, seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud; even of his arrogance, his pride, and his wrath. His boastings are nothing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore Moab will wail for Moab. Everyone will wail. You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth, utterly stricken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness. Its shoots were spread abroad. They passed over the sea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah. I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh: for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle shout has fallen.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there will be no singing, neither joyful noise. Nobody will tread out wine in the presses. I have made the shouting stop.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir Heres.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> It will happen that when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, and comes to his sanctuary to pray, that he will not prevail. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> This is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But now Yahweh has spoken, saying, “Within three years, as a worker bound by contract would count them, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude; and the remnant will be very small and feeble.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> The burden of Damascus. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it will be a ruinous heap.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The cities of Aroer are forsaken. They will be for flocks, which shall lie down, and no one shall make them afraid.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria. They will be as the glory of the children of Israel,” says Yahweh of Armies. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> “It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh will become lean.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat, and his arm reaps the grain. Yes, it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yet gleanings will be left there, like the shaking of an olive tree, two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree,” says Yahweh, the God of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> In that day, people will look to their Maker, and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands; neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made, either the Asherah poles, or the incense altars.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> In that day, their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel; and it will be a desolation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not remembered the rock of your strength. Therefore you plant pleasant plants, and set out foreign seedlings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> In the day of your planting, you hedge it in. In the morning, you make your seed blossom, but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Ah, the uproar of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters: but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far off, and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> At evening, behold, terror! Before the morning, they are no more. This is the portion of those who plunder us, and the lot of those who rob us. </span> </span>
