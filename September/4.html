		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> One called to another, and said, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies! </span> <span class="line">The whole earth is full of his glory!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He said, “Go, and tell this people, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">‘You hear indeed, </span> <span class="line">but don’t understand. </span> <span class="line">You see indeed, </span> <span class="line">but don’t perceive.’ </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> Make the heart of this people fat. </span> <span class="line">Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; </span> <span class="line">lest they see with their eyes, </span> <span class="line">hear with their ears, </span> <span class="line">understand with their heart, </span> <span class="line">and turn again, and be healed.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then I said, “Lord, how long?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He answered, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Until cities are waste without inhabitant, </span> <span class="line">houses without man, </span> <span class="line">the land becomes utterly waste, </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> and Yahweh has removed men far away, </span> <span class="line">and the forsaken places are many within the land. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">13</span> If there is a tenth left in it, </span> <span class="line">that also will in turn be consumed, </span> <span class="line">as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stump remains when they are cut down; </span> <span class="line">so the holy seed is its stock.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> David’s house was told, “Syria is allied with Ephraim.” His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller’s field.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Tell him, ‘Be careful, and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> “Let’s go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let’s divide it among ourselves, and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> This is what the Lord Yahweh says: “It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask. I won’t tempt Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He said, “Listen now, house of David. Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God also?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> For before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah, even the king of Assyria. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> It will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys, in the clefts of the rocks, on all thorn hedges, and on all pastures. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> It shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter; for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left within the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> It will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> shall be for briers and thorns.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all the land will be briers and thorns.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of oxen, and for sheep to tread on.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man’s pen, ‘For Maher Shalal Hash Baz’;</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then Yahweh said to me, “Call his name ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For before the child knows how to say, ‘My father,’ and, ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh spoke to me yet again, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> “Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River: the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> It will sweep onward into Judah. It will overflow and pass through. It will reach even to the neck. The stretching out of its wings will fill the width of your land, Immanuel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from far countries: dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be shattered!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand, for God is with us.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For Yahweh spoke this to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> “Don’t say, ‘A conspiracy!’ concerning all about which this people say, ‘A conspiracy!’ neither fear their threats, nor be terrorized.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh of Armies is who you must respect as holy. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must dread.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a stumbling stone and a rock that makes them fall. For the people of Jerusalem, he will be a trap and a snare.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared, and be captured.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Wrap up the covenant. Seal the law among my disciples.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies, who dwells in Mount Zion. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> When they tell you, “Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter,” shouldn’t a people consult with their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Turn to the law and to the covenant! If they don’t speak according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They will pass through it, very distressed and hungry. It will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by their God. They will turn their faces upward,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into thick darkness. </span> </span>
