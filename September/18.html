you compare to him? </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">19</span> A workman has cast an image, </span> <span class="line">and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, </span> <span

earth? </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">22</span> It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, </span> <span class="line">and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; </span> <span class="line">who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, </span> <span class="line">and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in, </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">23</span> who brings

<span class="line">who brings out their army by number. </span> <span class="line">He calls them all by name. </span> <span class="line">by the greatness of his might, </span> <span class="line">and because he is strong in power, </span> <span class="line">not one is lacking. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">27</span> Why do you say, Jacob, </span> <span class="line">and speak, Israel, </span> <span class="line">“My way is hidden from Yahweh, </span> <span class="line">and the justice due me is disregarded by my God?” </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">28</span> Haven’t you known? </span> <span class="line">Haven’t you heard? </span> <span class="line">The everlasting God, Yahweh, </span> <span class="line">the Creator of the ends of the earth, doesn’t faint. </span> <span class="line">He isn’t weary. </span> <span class="line">His understanding is unsearchable. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">29</span> He gives power to the weak. </span> <span class="line">He increases the strength of him who has no might. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">30</span> Even the youths faint and get weary, </span> <span class="line">and the young men utterly fall; </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">31</span> but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength. </span> <span class="line">They will mount up with wings like eagles. </span> <span class="line">They will run, and not be weary. </span> <span class="line">They will walk, and not faint. </span> <span class="line"> <span class="chapter">41</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Keep silent before me, islands, </span> <span class="line">and let the peoples renew their strength. </span> <span class="line">Let them come near, </span> <span class="line">then let them speak. </span> <span class="line">Let’s meet together for judgment. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> Who has raised up one from the east? </span> <span class="line">Who called him to his foot in righteousness? </span> <span class="line">He hands over nations to him </span> <span class="line">and makes him rule over kings. </span> <span class="line">He gives them like the dust to his sword, </span> <span class="line">like the driven stubble to his bow. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> He pursues them </span> <span class="line">and passes by safely, </span> <span class="line">even by a way that he had not gone with his feet. </span> <span class="line"><span

you, ‘You are my servant, I have chosen you and have not cast you away.’ </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> Don’t you be afraid, for I am with you. </span> <span
