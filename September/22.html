class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> Take the millstones and grind flour. </span> <span class="line">Remove your veil, lift up your skirt, uncover your legs, </span> <span class="line">and wade through the rivers. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> Your nakedness will be uncovered. </span> <span class="line">Yes, your shame will be seen. </span> <span class="line">I will take vengeance, </span> <span class="line">and will spare no one.” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> Our Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies is his name,

them no mercy. </span> <span class="line">You laid a very heavy yoke on the aged. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> You said, ‘I will be a princess forever,’ </span> <span class="line">so that you didn’t lay these things to your heart, </span> <span class="line">nor did you remember the results. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span

class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> But these two things will come to you in a moment in one day, </span> <span class="line">the loss of children and widowhood. </span> <span class="line">They will come on you in their full measure, </span> <span class="line">in the multitude of your sorceries, </span> <span class="line">and the great abundance of your enchantments. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> For you have trusted in your wickedness. </span> <span class="line">You have said, ‘No one sees me.’ </span> <span class="line">Your wisdom and your knowledge has perverted you. </span> <span class="line">You have said in your heart, ‘I am, and there is no one else besides me.’ </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore

the flame. </span> <span class="line">It won’t be a coal to warm at </span> <span class="line">or a fire to sit by. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">15</span> The things that you labored in will be like this: </span> <span class="line">those who have trafficked with you from your youth will each wander in his own way. </span> <span class="line">There will be no one to save you.

old. </span> <span class="line">Yes, they went out of my mouth, and I revealed them. </span> <span class="line">I did them suddenly, and they happened. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> Because I knew that you are obstinate, </span> <span class="line">and your neck is an iron sinew, </span> <span class="line">and your brow bronze; </span> <span

my praise, I hold it back for you </span> <span class="line">so that I don’t cut you off. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I have refined you, </span> <span

waves of the sea. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">19</span> Your offspring also would have been as the sand </span> <span class="line">and the descendants of your body like its grains.
