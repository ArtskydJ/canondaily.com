		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The deep’s fountains and the sky’s windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The waters continually receded from the earth. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters receded.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat’s mountains.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> At the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He himself sent out a dove to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned into the ship to him, for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He waited yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the ship.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The dove came back to him at evening and, behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she didn’t return to him any more. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dry.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> God spoke to Noah, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “Go out of the ship, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Noah went out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma. Yahweh said in his heart, “I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake because the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth. I will never again strike every living thing, as I have done.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night will not cease.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that moves along the ground, and all the fish of the sea, are delivered into your hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As I gave you the green herb, I have given everything to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I will surely require accounting for your life’s blood. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life of man.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Whoever sheds man’s blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> I will establish my covenant with you: All flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood. There will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> God said to Noah, “This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of Canaan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn’t see their father’s nakedness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> He said, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Canaan is cursed. </span> <span class="line">He will be a servant of servants to his brothers.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> He said, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem. </span> <span class="line">Let Canaan be his servant. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">27</span> May God enlarge Japheth. </span> <span class="line">Let him dwell in the tents of Shem. </span> <span class="line">Let Canaan be his servant.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, and then he died. </span> </span>

When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”</span> </span>
