Those who remained fled to the hills.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew. At that time, he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner. They were allies of Abram.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led out his three hundred eighteen trained men, born in his house, and pursued as far as Dan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative Lot and his goods, and the women also, and the other people. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He blessed him, and said, “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Abram gave him a tenth of all. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">1</span> After these things Yahweh’s word came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Don’t be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Abram said, “Lord</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> Yahweh, what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Abram said, “Behold, you have given no children to me: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Behold, Yahweh’s word came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh brought him outside, and said, “Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” He said to Abram, “So your offspring will be.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He believed in Yahweh, who credited it to him for righteousness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He said to Abram, “I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He said, “Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn’t divide the birds.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He said to Abram, “Know for sure that your offspring will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good old age.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, “I have given this land to your offspring, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bore him no children. She had a servant, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Sarai said to Abram, “See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to my servant. It may be that I will obtain children by her.” Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Sarai said to Abram, “This wrong is your fault. I gave my servant into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, she despised me. May Yahweh judge between me and you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever is good in your eyes.” Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh’s angel found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain on the way to Shur.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s servant, where did you come from? Where are you going?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">She said, “I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh’s angel said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh’s angel said to her, “I will greatly multiply your offspring, that they will not be counted for multitude.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh’s angel said to her, “Behold, you are with child, and will bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard your affliction.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He will be like a wild donkey among men. His hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him. He will live opposed to all of his brothers.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> She called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her, “You are a God who sees,” for she said, “Have I even stayed alive after seeing him?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Hagar bore a son for Abram. Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram. </span> </span>
