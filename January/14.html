I don’t know the day of my death.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and get me venison.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> ‘Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Go now to the flock and get me two good young goats from there. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He came to his father, and said, “My father?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Because Yahweh your God gave me success.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He didn’t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau’s hands. So he blessed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I am.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> His father Isaac said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Behold, the smell of my son </span> <span class="line">is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">28</span> God give you of the dew of the sky, </span> <span class="line">of the fatness of the earth, </span> <span class="line">and plenty of grain and new wine. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">29</span> Let peoples serve you, </span> <span class="line">and nations bow down to you. </span> <span class="line">Be lord over your brothers. </span> <span class="line">Let your mother’s sons bow down to you. </span> <span class="line">Cursed be everyone who curses you. </span> <span class="line">Blessed be everyone who blesses you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, my father.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> He said, “Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> He said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.” He said, “Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> Esau said to his father, “Do you have just one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.” Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> Isaac his father answered him, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Behold, your dwelling will be of the fatness of the earth, </span> <span class="line">and of the dew of the sky from above. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">40</span> You will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother. </span> <span class="line">It will happen, when you will break loose, </span> <span class="line">that you will shake his yoke from off your neck.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away—  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">46</span> Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">28</span><span class="verse">1</span> Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father. Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn’t please Isaac, his father.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Esau went to Ishmael, and took, in addition to the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He dreamed and saw a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, “I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. I will give the land you lie on to you and to your offspring.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Your offspring will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your offspring, all the families of the earth will be blessed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, “Surely Yahweh is in this place, and I didn’t know it.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He was afraid, and said, “How awesome this place is! This is none other than God’s house, and this is the gate of heaven.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, and Yahweh will be my God,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God’s house. Of all that you will give me I will surely give a tenth to you.” </span> </span>
