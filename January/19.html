Why have you come?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> They said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> So he called them in and provided a place to stay. On the next day Peter arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.  </span>
