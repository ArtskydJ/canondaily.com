He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They heard Yahweh God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh God said to the woman, “What have you done?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh God said to the serpent, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Because you have done this, </span> <span class="line">you are cursed above all livestock, </span> <span class="line">and above every animal of the field. </span> <span class="line">You shall go on your belly </span> <span class="line">and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">15</span> I will put hostility between you and the woman, </span> <span class="line">and between your offspring and her offspring. </span> <span class="line">He will bruise your head, </span> <span class="line">and you will bruise his heel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> To the woman he said, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. </span> <span class="line">You will bear children in pain. </span> <span class="line">Your desire will be for your husband, </span> <span class="line">and he will rule over you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> To Adam he said, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Because you have listened to your wife’s voice, </span> <span class="line">and ate from the tree, </span> <span class="line">about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’ </span> <span class="line">the ground is cursed for your sake. </span> <span class="line">You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">18</span> It will yield thorns and thistles to you; </span> <span class="line">and you will eat the herb of the field. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">19</span> You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground, </span> <span class="line">for you were taken out of it. </span> <span class="line">For you are dust, </span> <span class="line">and you shall return to dust.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The man called his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all the living.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh God made garments of animal skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Yahweh God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever—”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> The man knew</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> Eve his wife. She conceived,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man with Yahweh’s help.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Lamech said to his wives, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice. </span> <span class="line">You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, </span> <span class="line">for I have slain a man for wounding me, </span> <span class="line">a young man for bruising me. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">24</span> If Cain will be avenged seven times, </span> <span class="line">truly Lamech seventy-seven times.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Yahweh’s name. </span> </span>
