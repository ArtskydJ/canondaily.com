		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Yahweh said to Abram, “Leave your country, and your relatives, and your father’s house, and go to the land that I will show you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who treats you with contempt. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> So Abram went, as Yahweh had told him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother’s son, all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they went to go into the land of Canaan. They entered into the land of Canaan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time, Canaanites were in the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your offspring.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He built an altar there to Yahweh, who had appeared to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He left from there to go to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Yahweh and called on Yahweh’s name.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Abram traveled, still going on toward the South. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When he had come near to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> It will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They will kill me, but they will save you alive.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they escorted him away with his wife and all that he had. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> Abram went up out of Egypt—he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him—into the South.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He went on his journeys from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on Yahweh’s name.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their possessions were so great that they couldn’t live together.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves from one other.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> for I will give all the land which you see to you and to your offspring forever.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be counted.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh. </span> </span>

They recognized that they had been with Jesus.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> saying, “What shall we do to these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can’t deny it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> But so that this spreads no further among the people, let’s threaten them, that from now on they don’t speak to anyone in this name.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> But Peter and John answered them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> for we can’t help telling the things which we saw and heard.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old. </span> </span>
