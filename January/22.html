		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">39</span><span class="verse">1</span> Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> His master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and Potiphar made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake. Yahweh’s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He left all that he had in Joseph’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Joseph was well-built and handsome.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> After these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn’t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, “Behold, he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> She spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your servant did to me,” his wrath was kindled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> But Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The keeper of the prison didn’t look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">40</span><span class="verse">1</span> After these things, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They said to him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cup bearer.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But remember me when it is well with you. Please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> He restored the chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Yet the chief cup bearer didn’t remember Joseph, but forgot him. </span> </span>

They sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> who, when he had come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should remain near to the Lord.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Barnabas went out to Tarsus to look for Saul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> When he had found him, he brought him to Antioch.
