		<span class="header">Genesis 32-33</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">32</span><span class="verse">1</span> Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s army.” He called the name of that place Mahanaim. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> and he said, “If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can’t be counted because there are so many.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him a present for Esau, his brother:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’ ” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> When he saw that he didn’t prevail against him, the man touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained as he wrestled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Jacob said, “I won’t let you go unless you bless me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> He said to him, “What is your name?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Jacob”. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> He said, “Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Why is it that you ask what my name is?” He blessed him there. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Jacob called the name of the place Peniel;</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> for he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Therefore the children of Israel don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">33</span><span class="verse">1</span> Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two servants.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then the servants came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Jacob said, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Jacob said, “Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” He urged him, and he took it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Esau said, “Let’s take our journey, and let’s go, and I will go before you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the people who are with me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.</span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> But Saul, still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> As he traveled, he got close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He said, “Who are you, Lord?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The Lord said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But</span> <span class="paragraphtext">rise up and enter into the city, then you will be told what you must do.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one. They led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Ananias!”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Behold, it’s me, Lord.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The Lord said to him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judah</span> <span class="paragraphtext">for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> But the Lord said to him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Go your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings, and the children of Israel. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> For I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name’s sake.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Ananias departed and entered into the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and was baptized.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He took food and was strengthened. Saul stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus.  </span>
