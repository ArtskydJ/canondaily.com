		<span class="header">Genesis 17-18</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Abram fell on his face. God talked with him, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> “As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Your name will no more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your offspring after you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> God said to Abraham, “As for you, you will keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you. Every male among you shall be circumcised.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of the covenant between me and you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name will be Sarah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from her.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> God said, “No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son. You shall call his name Isaac.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money: every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">18</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood near him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and said, “My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don’t go away from your servant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I will get a piece of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said, “Very well, do as you have said.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly prepare three seahs</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> They asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “There, in the tent.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He said, “I will certainly return to you at about this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will I really bear a child when I am old?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then Sarah denied it, saying, “I didn’t laugh,” for she was afraid. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “No, but you did laugh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh said, “Will I hide from Abraham what I do,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh said, “Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Abraham came near, and said, “Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> May it be far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn’t the Judge of all the earth do right?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Yahweh said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Abraham answered, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, although I am dust and ashes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> He spoke to him yet again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> He said, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found there?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place. </span> </span>

After it was sold, wasn’t it in your power? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You haven’t lied to men, but to God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died. Great fear came on all who heard these things.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The young men arose and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Peter answered her, “Tell me whether you sold the land for so much.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">She said, “Yes, for so much.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> But Peter asked her, “How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> She fell down immediately at his feet and died.
