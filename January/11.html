		<span class="header">Genesis 22-23</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">22</span><span class="verse">1</span> After these things, God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Here I am.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He said, “Now take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey; and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there. We will worship, and come back to you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Here I am, my son.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they both went together.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh’s angel called to him out of the sky, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Here I am.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He said, “Don’t lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Abraham called the name of that place “Yahweh Will Provide”.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> As it is said to this day, “On Yahweh’s mountain, it will be provided.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh’s angel called to Abraham a second time out of the sky,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> and said, “ ‘I have sworn by myself,’ says Yahweh, ‘because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your offspring greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your offspring will possess the gate of his enemies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring, because you have obeyed my voice.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> After these things, Abraham was told, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">23</span><span class="verse">1</span> Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah’s life.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> “I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> “Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He talked with them, saying, “If you agree that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> that he may sell me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him sell it to me among you as a possession for a burial place.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> between me and you? Therefore bury your dead.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants’ standard. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham by the children of Heth as a possession for a burial place. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The word of God increased and the number of the disciples greatly multiplied in Jerusalem. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> But some of those who were of the synagogue called “The Libertines”, and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> They weren’t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, then brought him in to the council,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> and set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel. </span> </span>
