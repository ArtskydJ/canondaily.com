		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">34</span><span class="verse">1</span> Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter, a thing ought not to be done.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit when they spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> and said to them, “We can’t do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> then will we give our daughters to you; and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our sister,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and we will be gone.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The young man didn’t wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> “These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let’s take their daughters to us for wives, and let’s give them our daughters.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let’s give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> On the third day, when they were sore, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Jacob’s sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> They said, “Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">35</span><span class="verse">1</span> God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Let’s arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn’t pursue the sons of Jacob.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> God said to him, “Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel.” He named him Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> God said to him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your offspring after you I will give the land.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him “Bethel”. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> They traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for now you will have another son.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Benoni,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> but his father named him Benjamin.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel heard of it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> The sons of Bilhah (Rachel’s servant): Dan and Naphtali.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> The sons of Zilpah (Leah’s servant): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Isaac gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">20</span> Immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ, that he is the Son of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> All who heard him were amazed, and said, “Isn’t this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? And he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> But Saul increased more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> When many days were fulfilled, the Jews conspired together to kill him,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> but their plot became known to Saul. They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> but his disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> When Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> He was with them entering into</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> Jerusalem,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> He spoke and disputed against the Hellenists,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> but they were seeking to kill him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> When the brothers</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> So the assemblies throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace, and were built up. They were multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> As Peter went throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, because he was paralyzed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed!” Immediately he arose.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which when translated, means Dorcas.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> This woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> In those days, she became sick, and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> Peter got up and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper room. All the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> Peter sent them all out, and knelt down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> He gave her his hand, and raised her up. Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> This became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> He stayed many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon. </span> </span>
