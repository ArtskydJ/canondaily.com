		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">29</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and saw three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well’s mouth was large.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well’s mouth in its place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Jacob said to them, “My relatives, where are you from?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said, “We are from Haran.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He said to them, “Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said, “We know him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He said to them, “Is it well with him?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said, “It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He said, “Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They said, “We can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we water the sheep.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she kept them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative, and that he was Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” Jacob stayed with him for a month.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Jacob loved Rachel. He said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> In the evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to Jacob. He went in to her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Laban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah for a servant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> In the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Laban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for seven more years.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Laban gave Bilhah, his servant, to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him seven more years. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, “Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction; for now my husband will love me.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, “Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.” She named him Simeon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “This time I will praise Yahweh.” Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">30</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I will die.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in God’s place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> She said, “Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> She gave him Bilhah her servant as wife, and Jacob went in to her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Rachel said, “I have wrestled with my sister with mighty wrestlings, and have prevailed.” She named him Naphtali. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her servant, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Leah said, “How fortunate!” She named him Gad.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a second son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Leah said, “Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy.” She named him Asher. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Leah said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes, also?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He lay with her that night.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Leah said, “God has given me my hire, because I gave my servant to my husband.” She named him Issachar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons.” She named him Zebulun.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> She conceived, bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> She named him Joseph,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> saying, “May Yahweh add another son to me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Laban said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> He said, “Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Jacob said to him, “You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Laban said, “What shall I give you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be considered stolen.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> He set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, and plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in Laban’s flock. He put his own droves apart, and didn’t put them into Laban’s flock.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> Whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in front of the eyes of the flock in the watering troughs, that they might conceive among the rods;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> but when the flock were feeble, he didn’t put them in. So the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> Saul was consenting to his death. A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Devout men buried Stephen and lamented greatly over him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into every house and dragged both men and women off to prison.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip when they heard and saw the signs which he did.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> There was great joy in that city. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is that great power of God.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> They listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning God’s Kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Simon himself also believed. Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles occurring, he was amazed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> for as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> saying, “Give me also this power, that whomever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn’t right before God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> For I see that you are in the poison of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Simon answered, “Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans.  </span>
