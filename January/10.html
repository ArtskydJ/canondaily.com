		<span class="header">Genesis 20-21</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man’s wife.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister’? She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Abraham prayed to God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> She said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The child grew and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this servant and her son! For the son of this servant will not be heir with my son, Isaac.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> God said to Abraham, “Don’t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your servant. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For your offspring will be named through Isaac.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> I will also make a nation of the son of the servant, because he is your child.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a container of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The water in the container was spent, and she put the child under one of the shrubs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, “Don’t let me see the death of the child.” She sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> God heard the voice of the boy. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him with your hand. For I will make him a great nation.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the container with water, and gave the boy a drink.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and as he grew up, became an archer.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother got a wife for him out of the land of Egypt. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> At that time, Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Abraham said, “I will swear.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Abimelech said, “I don’t know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell me, and I didn’t hear of it until today.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs, which you have set by themselves, mean?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Therefore he called that place Beersheba,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> because they both swore an oath there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days. </span> </span>
