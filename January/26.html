		<span class="header">Genesis 44-45</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">44</span><span class="verse">1</span> He commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in his sack’s mouth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.” He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you rewarded evil for good?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Isn’t this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He said, “Now also let it be according to your words. He with whom it is found will be my slave; and you will be blameless.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then they hurried, and each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He searched, beginning with the oldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Don’t you know that such a man as I can indeed do divination?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Judah said, “What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? How will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup is found.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He said, “Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then Judah came near to him, and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and don’t let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> We said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> You said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> We said to my lord, ‘The boy can’t leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> You said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> When we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Our father said, ‘Go again and buy us a little food.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> We said, ‘We can’t go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man’s face, unless our youngest brother is with us.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> One went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces;” and I haven’t seen him since.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.’</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; since his life is bound up in the boy’s life;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I don’t bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, my lord’s slave; and let the boy go up with his brothers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn’t with me?—lest I see the evil that will come on my father.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">45</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Joseph couldn’t control himself before all those who stood before him, and he called out, “Cause everyone to go out from me!” No one else stood with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Does my father still live?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">His brothers couldn’t answer him; for they were terrified at his presence.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They came near. He said, “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Now don’t be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be no plowing and no harvest.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> So now it wasn’t you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says, “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don’t wait.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children’s children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> There I will provide for you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.” ’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Now you are commanded to do this: Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Also, don’t concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He sent the following to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, “See that you don’t quarrel on the way.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> They told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” His heart fainted, for he didn’t believe them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Israel said, “It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.” </span> </span>

John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia.
