class="verse">1</span> When men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> God’s sons saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they took any that they wanted for themselves as wives.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; so his days will be one hundred twenty years.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The Nephilim</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when God’s sons came in to men’s daughters and had children with them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of man’s heart was continually only evil.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground—man, along with animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky—for I am sorry that I have made them.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But Noah found favor in Yahweh’s eyes. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> This is the history of the generations of Noah: Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time. Noah walked with God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> God said to Noah, “I will bring an end to all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them and the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> This is how you shall make it. The length of the ship shall be three hundred cubits,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> You shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> I, even I, will bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort will come to you, to keep them alive.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Take with you some of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you, and for them.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Thus Noah did. He did all that God commanded him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to Noah, “Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the male and his female.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will destroy every living thing that I have made from the surface of the ground.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, because of the floodwaters.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Clean animals, unclean animals, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> After the seven days, the floodwaters came on the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the sky’s windows opened.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth—the sons of Noah—and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship—  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Pairs from all flesh with the breath of life in them went into the ship to Noah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; then Yahweh shut him in.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The waters rose, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The waters rose very high on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The waters rose fifteen cubits</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> higher, and the mountains were covered.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> All on the dry land, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days. </span> </span>
