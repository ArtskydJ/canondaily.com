The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women and the children also rejoiced; so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even far away. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> On that day, men were appointed over the rooms for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who waited.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> They performed the duty of their God, and the duty of the purification, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">46</span> For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">47</span> All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the gatekeepers, as every day required; and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron. </span> </span>
