The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> When I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned several days; and I fasted and prayed before the God</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of heaven,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> and said, “I beg you, Yahweh,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father’s house have sinned.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you trespass, I will scatter you among the peoples;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Lord,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> I beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who delight to fear your name; and please prosper your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Now I was cup bearer to the king. </span> </span>
