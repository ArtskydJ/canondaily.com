		<div class="header">Proud VS Broken</div>
		<div>
			<div class="subheader">Proud</div>
			Proud people have a subconscious feeling, “This ministry/church is privileged to have me and my gifts”; they think of what they can do for God.
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="subheader">Broken</div>
			Broken people’s heart attitude is, “I don’t deserve to have a part in any ministry”; they  know that they have nothing to offer God except the life of Jesus flowing through their  broken lives.
