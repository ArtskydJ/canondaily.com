	<div class="subheader">Proud vs. Broken</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Proud</div>
		Proud people have a subconscious feeling, “This ministry/church is privileged to have me and my gifts”; they think of what they can do for God.
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="subsubheader pvb">Broken</div>
		Broken people’s heart attitude is, “I don’t deserve to have a part in any ministry”; they  know that they have nothing to offer God except the life of Jesus flowing through their  broken lives.
