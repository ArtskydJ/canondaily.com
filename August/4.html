They are building the rebellious and bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Be it known now to the king that if this city is built and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not appropriate for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will see in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have started rebellions within it in the past. That is why this city was destroyed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> We inform the king that, if this city is built and the walls finished, then you will have no possession beyond the River. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions who live in Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River: </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">Peace. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> I decreed, and search has been made, and it was found that this city has made insurrection against kings in the past, and that rebellion and revolts have been made in it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Make a decree now to cause these men to cease, and that this city not be built, until a decree is made by me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Be careful that you not be slack doing so. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force of arms.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Then work stopped on God’s house which is at Jerusalem. It stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. </span> </span>
