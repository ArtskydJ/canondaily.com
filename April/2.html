		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Joshua got up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel. They camped there before they crossed over.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> After three days, the officers went through the middle of the camp;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of Yahweh your God’s covenant, and the Levitical priests bearing it, then leave your place and follow it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Yet there shall be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> by measure—don’t come closer to it—that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed this way before.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders among you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and cross over before the people.” They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Joshua said to the children of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your God.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite out from before you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> It shall be that when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan will be cut off. The waters that come down from above shall stand in one heap.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people passed over near Jericho.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The priests who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the nation had passed completely over the Jordan. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> When all the nation had completely crossed over the Jordan, Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Take twelve men out of the people, a man out of every tribe,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and command them, saying, ‘Take from out of the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, carry them over with you, and lay them down in the place where you’ll camp tonight.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, a man out of every tribe.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Joshua said to them, “Cross before the ark of Yahweh your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you pick up a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in the future, saying, ‘What do you mean by these stones?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> then you shall tell them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of Yahweh’s covenant. When it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel. They carried them over with them to the place where they camped, and laid them down there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and passed over.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When all the people had completely crossed over, Yahweh’s ark crossed over with the priests in the presence of the people. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war, passed over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> On that day, Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “Command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, that they come up out of the Jordan.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, “Come up out of the Jordan!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> When the priests who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant had come up out of the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet had been lifted up to the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks, as before.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, in Gilgal.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Then you shall let your children know, saying, ‘Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you until you had crossed over, as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had crossed over,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh’s hand is mighty, and that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> When all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel until we had crossed over, their heart melted, and there was no more spirit in them, because of the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make flint knives, and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> This is the reason Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way, after they came out of Egypt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they didn’t listen to Yahweh’s voice. Yahweh swore to them that he wouldn’t let them see the land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> When they were done circumcising the whole nation, they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel didn’t have manna any more, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our enemies?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He said, “No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh’s army.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and asked him, “What does my lord say to his servant?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The prince of Yahweh’s army said to Joshua, “Take off your sandals, for the place on which you stand is holy.” Joshua did so. </span> </span>
