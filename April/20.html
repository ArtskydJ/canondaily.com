		<span class="header">Judges 10-12</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> After Abimelech, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> After him Jair, the Gileadite, arose. He judged Israel twenty-two years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts. They had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Jair died, and was buried in Kamon. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and served the Baals, the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. They abandoned Yahweh, and didn’t serve him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the children of Ammon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was very distressed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, saying, “We have sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baals.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh said to the children of Israel, “Didn’t I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods. Therefore I will save you no more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The children of Israel said to Yahweh, “We have sinned! Do to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us, please, today.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> They put away the foreign gods from among them and served Yahweh; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then the children of Ammon were gathered together and encamped in Gilead. The children of Israel assembled themselves together and encamped in Mizpah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The people, the princes of Gilead, said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor. He was the son of a prostitute. Gilead became the father of Jephthah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Gilead’s wife bore him sons. When his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You will not inherit in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Outlaws joined up with Jephthah, and they went out with him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> After a while, the children of Ammon made war against Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> When the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> They said to Jephthah, “Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Didn’t you hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us and fight with the children of Ammon. You will be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivers them before me, will I be your head?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Yahweh will be witness between us. Surely we will do what you say.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them. Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh in Mizpah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, “What do you have to do with me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The king of the children of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore restore that territory again peaceably.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> and he said to him, “Jephthah says: Israel didn’t take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let me pass through your land;’ but the king of Edom didn’t listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab, but he refused; so Israel stayed in Kadesh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they didn’t come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, ‘Please let us pass through your land to my place.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> But Sihon didn’t trust Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them. So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Won’t you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along the side of the Arnon for three hundred years! Why didn’t you recover them within that time?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. May Yahweh the Judge be judge today between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> However, the king of the children of Ammon didn’t listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Then Yahweh’s Spirit came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> then it shall be, that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. She was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> When he saw her, he tore his clothes, and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Yahweh, and I can’t go back.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> She said to him, “My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh; do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth, because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Then she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me. Leave me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> He said, “Go.” He sent her away for two months; and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her virginity on the mountains.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> At the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed. She was a virgin. It became a custom in Israel  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> The men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah, “Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didn’t call us to go with you? We will burn your house around you with fire!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you didn’t save me out of their hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> When I saw that you didn’t save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me today, to fight against me?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim. The men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the middle of Ephraim, and in the middle of Manasseh.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. Whenever a fugitive of Ephraim said, “Let me go over,” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No;”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> then they said to him, “Now say ‘Shibboleth;’ ” and he said “Sibboleth”; for he couldn’t manage to pronounce it correctly, then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time, forty-two thousand of Ephraim fell. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in the cities of Gilead. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He had thirty sons. He sent his thirty daughters outside his clan, and he brought in thirty daughters from outside his clan for his sons. He judged Israel seven years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He had forty sons and thirty sons’ sons who rode on seventy donkey colts. He judged Israel eight years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites. </span> </span>
