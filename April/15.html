		<span class="header">Judges 2-3</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s angel came up from Gilgal to Bochim. He said, “I brought you out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to give your fathers. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> You shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You shall break down their altars.’ But you have not listened to my voice. Why have you done this?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> When Yahweh’s angel spoke these words to all the children of Israel, the people lifted up their voice and wept.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> They called the name of that place Bochim,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and they sacrificed there to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel each went to his inheritance to possess the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> After all that generation were gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who didn’t know Yahweh, nor the work which he had done for Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and served the Baals.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; and they provoked Yahweh to anger.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> They abandoned Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Wherever they went out, Yahweh’s hand was against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them; and they were very distressed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Yet they didn’t listen to their judges; for they prostituted themselves to other gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They quickly turned away from the way in which their fathers walked, obeying Yahweh’s commandments. They didn’t do so.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> When Yahweh raised up judges for them, then Yahweh was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> But when the judge was dead, they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down to them. They didn’t cease what they were doing, or give up their stubborn ways.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel; and he said, “Because this nation transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to my voice,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> I also will no longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died from before them;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> that by them I may test Israel, to see if they will keep Yahweh’s way to walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily. He didn’t deliver them into Joshua’s hand. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to test Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at least those who knew nothing of it before:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> They were left to test Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to Yahweh’s commandments, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> They took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh’s Spirit came on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. His hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The land had rest forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> When Ehud had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> But he himself turned back from the stone idols that were by Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The king said, “Keep silence!” All who stood by him left him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, “I have a message from God to you.” He arose out of his seat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn’t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> After he had gone, his servants came and saw that the doors of the upper room were locked. They said, “Surely he is covering his feet</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> in the upper room.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn’t open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Ehud escaped while they waited, passed beyond the stone idols, and escaped to Seirah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> When he had come, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> He said to them, “Follow me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn’t allow any man to pass over.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> They struck at that time about ten thousand men of Moab, every strong man and every man of valor. No man escaped.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had rest eighty years. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. He also saved Israel. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don’t torment me.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For he said to him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He asked him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“What is your name?”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said to him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> All the demons begged him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The people came to see what it was that had happened.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Those who saw it declared to them what happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> They began to beg him to depart from their region. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He didn’t allow him, but said to him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled. </span> </span>

		<span class="header">1 Corinthians 9:13-27</span>
		
		<span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">13</span> Don’t you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> But I have used none of these things, and I don’t write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me if I don’t preach the Good News.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> What then is my reward? That when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Don’t you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that you may win.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> I therefore run like that, not aimlessly. I fight like that, not beating the air,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected. </span> </span>
