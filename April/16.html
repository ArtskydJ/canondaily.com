Nevertheless, the journey that you take won’t be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into a woman’s hand.” Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; and Deborah went up with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Deborah said to Barak, “Go; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn’t Yahweh gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh confused Sisera, all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled away on his feet.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don’t be afraid.” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">She opened a container of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He said to her, “Stand in the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so he fainted and died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.” He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel on that day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> “Because the leaders took the lead in Israel, </span> <span class="line">because the people offered themselves willingly, </span> <span class="line">be blessed, Yahweh! </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> “Hear, you kings! </span> <span class="line">Give ear, you princes! </span> <span class="line">I, even I, will sing to Yahweh. </span> <span class="line">I will sing praise to Yahweh, the God of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> “Yahweh, when you went out of Seir, </span> <span class="line">when you marched out of the field of Edom, </span> <span class="line">the earth trembled, the sky also dropped. </span> <span class="line">Yes, the clouds dropped water. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> The mountains quaked Yahweh’s presence, </span> <span class="line">even Sinai at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> “In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, </span> <span class="line">in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied. </span> <span class="line">The travelers walked through byways. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> The rulers ceased in Israel. </span> <span class="line">They ceased until I, Deborah, arose; </span> <span class="line">Until I arose a mother in Israel. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> They chose new gods. </span> <span class="line">Then war was in the gates. </span> <span class="line">Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> A certain woman, who had a discharge of blood for twelve years,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Who touched my clothes?”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> His disciples said to him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> He looked around to see her who had done this thing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> He said to her, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Don’t be afraid, only believe.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> When he had entered in, he said to them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Talitha cumi!” </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> which means, being interpreted, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Girl, I tell you, get up!” </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat. </span> </span>
