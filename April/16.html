Nevertheless, the journey that you take won’t be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into a woman’s hand.” Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; and Deborah went up with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Deborah said to Barak, “Go; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn’t Yahweh gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh confused Sisera, all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled away on his feet.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don’t be afraid.” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">She opened a container of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He said to her, “Stand in the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so he fainted and died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.” He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel on that day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> “Because the leaders took the lead in Israel, </span> <span class="line">because the people offered themselves willingly, </span> <span class="line">be blessed, Yahweh! </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> “Hear, you kings! </span> <span class="line">Give ear, you princes! </span> <span class="line">I, even I, will sing to Yahweh. </span> <span class="line">I will sing praise to Yahweh, the God of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> “Yahweh, when you went out of Seir, </span> <span class="line">when you marched out of the field of Edom, </span> <span class="line">the earth trembled, the sky also dropped. </span> <span class="line">Yes, the clouds dropped water. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> The mountains quaked Yahweh’s presence, </span> <span class="line">even Sinai at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> “In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, </span> <span class="line">in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied. </span> <span class="line">The travelers walked through byways. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> The rulers ceased in Israel. </span> <span class="line">They ceased until I, Deborah, arose; </span> <span class="line">Until I arose a mother in Israel. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> They chose new gods. </span> <span class="line">Then war was in the gates. </span> <span class="line">Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
