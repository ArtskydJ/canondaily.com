		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> The men of Ephraim said to him, “Why have you treated us this way, that you didn’t call us when you went to fight with Midian?” They rebuked him sharply.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He said to them, “What have I now done in comparison with you? Isn’t the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb! What was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over, he and the three hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The princes of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Gideon said, “Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army; for the army felt secure.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Zebah and Zalmunna fled and he pursued them. He took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and confused all the army.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, seventy-seven men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He came to the men of Succoth, and said, “See Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They answered, “They were like you. They all resembled the children of a king.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Yahweh lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He said to Jether his firstborn, “Get up and kill them!” But the youth didn’t draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “You rise and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’ necks. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you, your son, and your son’s son also; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you. Yahweh shall rule over you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Gideon said to them, “I do have a request: that you would each give me the earrings of his plunder.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> They answered, “We will willingly give them.” They spread a garment, and every man threw the earrings of his plunder into it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred shekels</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of gold, in addition to the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on the kings of Midian, and in addition to the chains that were about their camels’ necks.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Gideon made an ephod out of it, and put it in Ophrah, his city. Then all Israel played the prostitute with it there; and it became a snare to Gideon and to his house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. The land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body, for he had many wives.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> His concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> As soon as Gideon was dead, the children of Israel turned again and played the prostitute following the Baals, and made Baal Berith their god.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> The children of Israel didn’t remember Yahweh their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">14</span> King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, “John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> But others said, “He is Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But Herod, when he heard this, said, “This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, for he had married her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> For John said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn’t,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He swore to her, “Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> She went out, and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">She said, “The head of John the Baptizer.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn’t wish to refuse her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John’s head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But I would have you know that the head</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of every man is Christ, and the head</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of the woman is man, and the head</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of Christ is God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or be shaved, let her be covered.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For man is not from woman, but woman from man;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> for man wasn’t created for the woman, but woman for the man.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For this cause the woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Doesn’t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God’s assemblies. </span> </span>
