It reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrise.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> The border of their inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol, Irshemesh,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> Elon, Timnah, Ekron,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">46</span> Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border opposite Joppa.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">47</span> The border of the children of Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their forefather.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">48</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">49</span> So they finished distributing the land for inheritance by its borders. The children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">50</span> According to Yahweh’s commandment, they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and lived there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">51</span> These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Assign the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> that the man slayer who kills any person accidentally or unintentionally may flee there. They shall be to you for a refuge from the avenger of blood.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He shall flee to one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his case in the ears of the elders of that city. They shall take him into the city with them, and give him a place, that he may live among them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> If the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not deliver up the man slayer into his hand; because he struck his neighbor unintentionally, and didn’t hate him before.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days. Then the man slayer shall return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city he fled from.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the alien who lives among them, that whoever kills any person unintentionally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stands trial before the congregation. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Let the husband give his wife the affection owed her,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and likewise also the wife her husband.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The wife doesn’t have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn’t have authority over his own body, but the wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Don’t deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn’t tempt you because of your lack of self-control. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> But if they don’t have self-control, let them marry. For it’s better to marry than to burn.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> But to the married I command—not I, but the Lord—that the wife not leave her husband  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> (but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But to the rest I—not the Lord—say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?  </span>
