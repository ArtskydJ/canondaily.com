Therefore now return and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their tents.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan; but Joshua gave to the other half among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> and spoke to them, saying, “Return with much wealth to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very much clothing. Divide the plunder of your enemies with your brothers.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they owned, according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> When they came to the region near the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a great altar to look at.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The children of Israel heard this, “Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar along the border of the land of Canaan, in the region around the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the children of Israel.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> When the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> With him were ten princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were each head of their fathers’ houses among the thousands of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> They came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “The whole congregation of Yahweh says, ‘What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away today from following Yahweh, in that you have built yourselves an altar, to rebel today against Yahweh?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> that you must turn away today from following Yahweh? It will be, since you rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> However, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh, in which Yahweh’s tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us; but don’t rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us, in building an altar other than Yahweh our God’s altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Didn’t Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? That man didn’t perish alone in his iniquity.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> “The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows; and Israel shall know: if it was in rebellion, or if in trespass against Yahweh (don’t save us today),  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh; or if to offer burnt offering or meal offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings, let Yahweh himself require it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> “If we have not out of concern done this, and for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, “What have you to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> For Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad. You have no portion in Yahweh.” ’ So your children might make our children cease from fearing Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> “Therefore we said, ‘Let’s now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> but it will be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may perform the service of Yahweh before him with our burnt offerings, with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings;’ that your children may not tell our children in time to come, ‘You have no portion in Yahweh.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> “Therefore we said, ‘It shall be, when they tell us or our generations this in time to come, that we shall say, “Behold the pattern of Yahweh’s altar, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you.” ’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> “Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and turn away today from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice, besides Yahweh our God’s altar that is before his tabernacle!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh is among us, because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh. Now you have delivered the children of Israel out of Yahweh’s hand.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad lived.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> The children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar “A Witness Between Us that Yahweh is God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">23</span><span class="verse">1</span> After many days, when Yahweh had given rest to Israel from their enemies all around, and Joshua was old and well advanced in years,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said to them, “I am old and well advanced in years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> You have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations because of you; for it is Yahweh your God who has fought for you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Behold, I have allotted to you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea toward the going down of the sun.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh your God will thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight. You shall possess their land, as Yahweh your God spoke to you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> “Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that you not turn away from it to the right hand or to the left;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> that you not come among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves to them;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> but hold fast to Yahweh your God, as you have done to this day. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “For Yahweh has driven great and strong nations out from before you. But as for you, no man has stood before you to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> One man of you shall chase a thousand; for it is Yahweh your God who fights for you, as he spoke to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love Yahweh your God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> “But if you do at all go back, and hold fast to the remnant of these nations, even these who remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> know for a certainty that Yahweh your God will no longer drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap to you, a scourge in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which Yahweh your God has given you. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> “Behold, today I am going the way of all the earth. You know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which Yahweh your God spoke concerning you. All have happened to you. Not one thing has failed of it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> It shall happen that as all the good things have come on you of which Yahweh your God spoke to you, so Yahweh will bring on you all the evil things, until he has destroyed you from off this good land which Yahweh your God has given you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> when you disobey the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow down yourselves to them. Then Yahweh’s anger will be kindled against you, and you will perish quickly from off the good land which he has given to you.” </span> </span>
