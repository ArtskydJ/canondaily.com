		<span class="header">Joshua 17-18</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> This was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> So this was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, for the children of Helek, for the children of Asriel, for the children of Shechem, for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida. These were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> They came to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the princes, saying, “Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” Therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Ten parts fell to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem. The border went along to the right hand, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook. These cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and ended at the sea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border. They reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Manasseh had three heights in Issachar, in Asher Beth Shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Yet the children of Manasseh couldn’t drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When the children of Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn’t utterly drive them out.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance, since we are a numerous people, because Yahweh has blessed us so far?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest, and clear land for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The children of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us. All the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth Shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, that is, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, “You are a numerous people, and have great power. You shall not have one lot only;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> but the hill country shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it’s farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">18</span><span class="verse">1</span> The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the Tent of Meeting there. The land was subdued before them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Seven tribes remained among the children of Israel, which had not yet divided their inheritance.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Joshua said to the children of Israel, “How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe. I will send them, and they shall arise, walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; then they shall come to me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> They shall divide it into seven portions. Judah shall live in his borders on the south, and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> You shall survey the land into seven parts, and bring the description here to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> However, the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance east of the Jordan, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The men arose and went. Joshua commanded those who went to survey the land, saying, “Go walk through the land, survey it, and come again to me. I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The men went and passed through the land, and surveyed it by cities into seven portions in a book. They came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh. There Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families. The border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan. The border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward. It ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz (also called Bethel), southward. The border went down to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Horon the lower.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The border extended, and turned around on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before Beth Horon southward; and ended at Kiriath Baal (also called Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah. This was the west quarter.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The south quarter was from the farthest part of Kiriath Jearim. The border went out westward, and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The border went down to the farthest part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward. It went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En Rogel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> It extended northward, went out at En Shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim. It went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> It passed along to the side opposite the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the south border.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The Jordan was its border on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders around it, according to their families.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Chephar Ammoni, Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Zelah, Eleph, the Jebusite (also called Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families. </span> </span>
