		<span class="header">Joshua 8-9</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, “Don’t be afraid, and don’t be dismayed. Take all the warriors with you, and arise, go up to Ai. Behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, with his people, his city, and his land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king, except you shall take its goods and its livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> So Joshua arose, with all the warriors, to go up to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them out by night.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He commanded them, saying, “Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Don’t go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> They will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, ‘They flee before us, like the first time.’ So we will flee before them,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> It shall be, when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do this according to Yahweh’s word. Behold, I have commanded you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Joshua sent them out; and they went to set up the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai on the west side of Ai; but Joshua stayed among the people that night.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Joshua rose up early in the morning, mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> All the people, even the men of war who were with him, went up and came near, and came before the city and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the middle of the valley.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When the king of Ai saw it, they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he didn’t know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> All the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them. They pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who didn’t go out after Israel. They left the city open, and pursued Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and entered into the city and took it. They hurried and set the city on fire.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. The people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned back and killed the men of Ai.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The others came out of the city against them, so they were in the middle of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. They struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> They captured the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the people of Ai.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> For Joshua didn’t draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Israel took for themselves only the livestock and the goods of that city, according to Yahweh’s word which he commanded Joshua.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until the evening. At sundown, Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised a great heap of stones on it that remains to this day. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses: an altar of uncut stones, on which no one had lifted up any iron. They offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh and sacrificed peace offerings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> He wrote there on the stones a copy of Moses’ law, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> All Israel, with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests, who carried the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, the foreigner as well as the native; half of them in front of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua didn’t read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> When all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of it  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys, and old, torn-up and bound up wine skins,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> and old and patched sandals on their feet, and wore old garments. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> They went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country. Now therefore make a covenant with us.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The men of Israel said to the Hivites, “What if you live among us? How could we make a covenant with you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Joshua said to them, “Who are you? Where do you come from?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> They said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of Yahweh your God; for we have heard of his fame, all that he did in Egypt,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take supplies in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them. Tell them, “We are your servants. Now make a covenant with us.” ’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> This our bread we took hot for our supplies out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and has become moldy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> These wine skins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The men sampled their provisions, and didn’t ask counsel from Yahweh’s mouth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the congregation swore to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they lived among them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The children of Israel traveled and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The children of Israel didn’t strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. All the congregation murmured against the princes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> But all the princes said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. Now therefore we may not touch them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> We will do this to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The princes said to them, “Let them live.” So they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you live among us?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never fail to be slaves, both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> They answered Joshua, and said, “Because your servants were certainly told how Yahweh your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> He did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they didn’t kill them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> That day Joshua made them wood cutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for Yahweh’s altar to this day, in the place which he should choose. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, you aren’t ready even now,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed, and each as the Lord gave to him?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Don’t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God’s Spirit lives in you?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s. </span> </span>
