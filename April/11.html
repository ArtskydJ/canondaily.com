It was this way with all these cities. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers. They possessed it, and lived in it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> Yahweh gave them rest all around, according to all that he swore to their fathers. Not a man of all their enemies stood before them. Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> Nothing failed of any good thing which Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel. All came to pass. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">17</span> Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all the assemblies. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Was anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Were you called being a bondservant? Don’t let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord’s free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Christ’s bondservant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> You were bought with a price. Don’t become bondservants of men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Therefore I think that because of the distress that is on us, that it’s good for a man to remain as he is.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Are you bound to a wife? Don’t seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don’t seek a wife.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> and those who weep, as though they didn’t weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn’t rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn’t possess;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away.  </span>
