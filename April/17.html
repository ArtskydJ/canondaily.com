		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, so Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made themselves the dens which are in the mountains, the caves, and the strongholds.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> So it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the children of the east came up against them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> They encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, until you come to Gaza. They left no sustenance in Israel, and no sheep, ox, or donkey.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For they came up with their livestock and their tents. They came in as locusts for multitude. Both they and their camels were without number; and they came into the land to destroy it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh because of Midian,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel; and he said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you out of the house of bondage.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> I said to you, “I am Yahweh your God. You shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.” But you have not listened to my voice.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh’s angel came and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh’s angel appeared to him, and said to him, “Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of valor!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Gideon said to him, “Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, ‘Didn’t Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?’ But now Yahweh has cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh looked at him, and said, “Go in this your might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Haven’t I sent you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He said to him, “O Lord,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> how shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh said to him, “Surely I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Please don’t go away until I come to you, and bring out my present, and lay it before you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I will wait until you come back.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes of an ephah </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of meal. He put the meat in a basket and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He did so.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then Yahweh’s angel stretched out the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and fire went up out of the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. Then Yahweh’s angel departed out of his sight. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Gideon saw that he was Yahweh’s angel; and Gideon said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh! Because I have seen Yahweh’s angel face to face!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh said to him, “Peace be to you! Don’t be afraid. You shall not die.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh, and called it “Yahweh is Peace.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> That same night, Yahweh said to him, “Take your father’s bull, even the second bull seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Then build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold, in an orderly way, and take the second bull, and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Yahweh had spoken to him. Because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city, he could not do it by day, but he did it by night. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> They said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">When they inquired and asked, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? He who will contend for him, let him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has broken down his altar!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Therefore on that day he named him Jerub-Baal,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> saying, “Let Baal contend against him, because he has broken down his altar.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> But Yahweh’s Spirit came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together to follow him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they also were gathered together to follow him. He sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I’ll know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> It was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> Gideon said to God, “Don’t let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Please let me make a trial just this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> God did so that night; for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early and encamped beside the spring of Harod. Midian’s camp was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel brag against me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.’ ” So twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh said to Gideon, “There are still too many people. Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. It shall be, that those whom I tell you, ‘This shall go with you,’ shall go with you; and whoever I tell you, ‘This shall not go with you,’ shall not go.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> So he brought down the people to the water; and Yahweh said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set him by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh said to Gideon, “I will save you by the three hundred men who lapped, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, each to his own place.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of the men of Israel to their own tents, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> That same night, Yahweh said to him, “Arise, go down into the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> You will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp.” Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow. He said, “Behold, I dreamed a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> His fellow answered, “This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has delivered Midian into his hand, with all the army.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he worshiped. Then he returned into the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for Yahweh has delivered the army of Midian into your hand!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all them trumpets and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He said to them, “Watch me, and do likewise. Behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so you shall do.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, ‘For Yahweh and for Gideon!’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch. Then they blew the trumpets and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The three companies blew the trumpets, broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they shouted, “The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They each stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put them to flight.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every man’s sword against his fellow and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued Midian.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against Midian and take the waters before them as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan!” So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together and took the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at Oreb’s rock, and Zeeb they killed at Zeeb’s wine press, as they pursued Midian. Then they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan. </span> </span>
