		<span class="header">Joshua 6-7</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one came in.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, “Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the mighty men of valor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> All of your men of war shall march around the city, going around the city once. You shall do this six days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the city wall shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up, every man straight in front of him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Yahweh’s ark.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> They said to the people, “Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh’s ark.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Yahweh advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of Yahweh’s covenant followed them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets sounded as they went. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> So he caused Yahweh’s ark to go around the city, circling it once. Then they came into the camp, and stayed in the camp.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up Yahweh’s ark.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of Yahweh’s ark went on continually, and blew the trumpets. The armed men went in front of them. The rear guard came after Yahweh’s ark. The trumpets sounded as they went.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> On the seventh day, they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times. On this day only they marched around the city seven times.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> At the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for Yahweh has given you the city!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh. Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But as for you, only keep yourselves from what is devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so you would make the camp of Israel accursed and trouble it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> But all the silver, gold, and vessels of bronze and iron are holy to Yahweh. They shall come into Yahweh’s treasury.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> So the people shouted and the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight in front of him, and they took the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house, and bring the woman and all that she has out from there, as you swore to her.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all of her relatives, and they set them outside of the camp of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> They burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> But Rahab the prostitute, her father’s household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lives in the middle of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Joshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed is the man before Yahweh who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he will set up its gates.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against the children of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the land.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The men went up and spied out Ai.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> They returned to Joshua, and said to him, “Don’t let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Don’t make all the people to toil there, for there are only a few of them.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> So about three thousand men of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men of them. They chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted, and became like water.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before Yahweh’s ark until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Joshua said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after Israel has turned their backs before their enemies?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, “Get up! Why have you fallen on your face like that?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken some of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it among their own stuff.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore the children of Israel can’t stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Get up! Sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, “There is a devoted thing among you, Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. It shall be that the tribe which Yahweh selects shall come near by families. The family which Yahweh selects shall come near by households. The household which Yahweh selects shall come near man by man.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed Yahweh’s covenant, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes. The tribe of Judah was selected.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He brought near the family of Judah, and he selected the family of the Zerahites. He brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was selected.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He brought near his household man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make confession to him. Tell me now what you have done! Don’t hide it from me!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Achan answered Joshua, and said, “I have truly sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and this is what I have done.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When I saw among the plunder a beautiful Babylonian robe, two hundred shekels</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them. Behold, they are hidden in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver under it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> They took them from the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel. They laid them down before Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you today.” All Israel stoned him with stones, and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> They raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called “The valley of Achor” to this day. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> When I came to you, brothers, I didn’t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> that your faith wouldn’t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown, yet a wisdom not of this world nor of the rulers of this world who are coming to nothing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of glory.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> But as it is written, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Things which an eye didn’t see, and an ear didn’t hear, </span> <span class="line">which didn’t enter into the heart of man, </span> <span class="line">these God has prepared for those who love him.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God’s Spirit.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But we received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> We also speak these things, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Now the natural man doesn’t receive the things of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can’t know them, because they are spiritually discerned.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?” </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> But we have Christ’s mind. </span> </span>
