		<span class="header">Judges 13-15</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and childless.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh’s angel appeared to the woman, and said to her, “See now, you are barren and childless; but you shall conceive and bear a son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and don’t eat any unclean thing;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> for, behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son. No razor shall come on his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb. He shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, “A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome. I didn’t ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> but he said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink. Don’t eat any unclean thing, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, “Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us, and teach us what we should do to the child who shall be born.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah, her husband, wasn’t with her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The woman hurried and ran, and told her husband, saying to him, “Behold, the man who came to me that day has appeared to me,” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Manoah arose and followed his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I am.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Manoah said, “Now let your words happen. What shall the child’s way of life and mission be?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh’s angel said to Manoah, “Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. Let her observe all that I commanded her.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Manoah said to Yahweh’s angel, “Please stay with us, that we may make a young goat ready for you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh’s angel said to Manoah, “Though you detain me, I won’t eat your bread. If you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.” For Manoah didn’t know that he was Yahweh’s angel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Manoah said to Yahweh’s angel, “What is your name, that when your words happen, we may honor you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why do you ask about my name, since it is incomprehensible</span> <span class="paragraphtext">?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh. Then the angel did an amazing thing as Manoah and his wife watched.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> For when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, Yahweh’s angel ascended in the flame of the altar. Manoah and his wife watched; and they fell on their faces to the ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> But Yahweh’s angel didn’t appear to Manoah or to his wife any more. Then Manoah knew that he was Yahweh’s angel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, because we have seen God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> But his wife said to him, “If Yahweh were pleased to kill us, he wouldn’t have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, and he wouldn’t have shown us all these things, nor would he have told us such things as these at this time.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The woman bore a son and named him Samson. The child grew, and Yahweh blessed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Yahweh’s Spirit began to move him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He came up, and told his father and his mother, saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore get her for me as my wife.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Then his father and his mother said to him, “Isn’t there a woman among your brothers’ daughters, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she pleases me well.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> But his father and his mother didn’t know that it was of Yahweh; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines ruled over Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and his mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion roared at him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on him, and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat with his bare hands, but he didn’t tell his father or his mother what he had done.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> After a while he returned to take her, and he went over to see the carcass of the lion; and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went. He came to his father and mother and gave to them, and they ate, but he didn’t tell them that he had taken the honey out of the lion’s body.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> His father went down to the woman; and Samson made a feast there, for the young men used to do so.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle now. If you can tell me the answer within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> but if you can’t tell me the answer, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said to him, “Tell us your riddle, that we may hear it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He said to them, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“Out of the eater came out food. </span> <span class="line">Out of the strong came out sweetness.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They couldn’t in three days declare the riddle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> On the seventh day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Isn’t that so?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, “You just hate me, and don’t love me. You’ve told a riddle to the children of my people, and haven’t told it to me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said to her, “Behold, I haven’t told my father or my mother, so why should I tell you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and on the seventh day, he told her, because she pressed him severely; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said to them, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer, </span> <span class="line">you wouldn’t have found out my riddle.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck thirty men of them. He took their plunder, then gave the changes of clothing to those who declared the riddle. His anger burned, and he went up to his father’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his friend. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">1</span> But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat. He said, “I will go in to my wife’s room.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">But her father wouldn’t allow him to go in.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Her father said, “I most certainly thought that you utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please, take her instead.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless in the case of the Philistines when I harm them.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the middle between every two tails.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> When he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.” The Philistines came up, and burned her and her father with fire. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Samson said to them, “If you behave like this, surely I will take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cave in Etam’s rock.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cave in Etam’s rock, and said to Samson, “Don’t you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They said to him, “We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> They spoke to him, saying, “No, but we will bind you securely and deliver you into their hands; but surely we will not kill you.” They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. Then Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that was burned with fire; and his bands dropped from off his hands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, put out his hand, took it, and struck a thousand men with it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps; with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> When he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi.</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh and said, “You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die of thirst, and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore its name was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines. </span> </span>

If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> If they were all one member, where would the body be?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> But now they are many members, but one body.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need for you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> whereas our presentable parts have no such need.
