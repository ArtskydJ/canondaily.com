		<span class="header">Ruth 2</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Naomi had a relative of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">She said to her, “Go, my daughter.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “May Yahweh be with you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They answered him, “May Yahweh bless you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, “Whose young lady is this?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Boaz answered her, “I have been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t reproach her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of barley.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by Yahweh, who has not abandoned his kindness to the living and to the dead.” Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law. </span> </span>

If the dead aren’t raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then “let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Don’t be deceived! “Evil companionships corrupt good morals.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Wake up righteously, and don’t sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> But someone will say, “How are the dead raised?” and, “With what kind of body do they come?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> That which you sow, you don’t sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown perishable; it is raised imperishable.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul.” </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.  </span>
