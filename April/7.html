Yahweh said to him, “You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border of Ekron northward, which is counted as Canaanite; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians. I will drive them out from before the children of Israel. Just allocate it to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (who was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses attacked these, and drove them out.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Nevertheless the children of Israel didn’t drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath live within Israel to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Only he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The offerings of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as he spoke to him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar in the mount of the valley,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, Beth Jeshimoth,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> The children of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the soothsayer, with the sword, among the rest of their slain. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The border of the children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and its villages. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad, according to their families.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is near Rabbah;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan’s bank, to the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and its villages. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Half Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> But Moses gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi. Yahweh, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spoke to them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> These are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed to them,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. They gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses, and they divided the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then the children of Judah came near to Joshua in Gilgal. Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land. I brought him word again as it was in my heart.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Nevertheless, my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land where you walked shall be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have wholly followed Yahweh my God.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. Now, behold, I am eighty-five years old, today.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> As yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war, to go out and to come in.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and great and fortified cities. It may be that Yahweh will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh said.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he followed Yahweh, the God of Israel wholeheartedly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba, after the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war. </span> </span>
