They served other gods.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his offspring,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and gave him Isaac.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau Mount Seir, to possess it. Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> “ ‘I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and you came to the sea. The Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> When they cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. You lived in the wilderness many days. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “ ‘I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond the Jordan. They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand. You possessed their land, and I destroyed them from before you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. He sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still. So I delivered you out of his hand. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “ ‘You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword, nor with your bow.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you didn’t build, and you live in them. You eat of vineyards and olive groves which you didn’t plant.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> “Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth. Put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, in Egypt; and serve Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> If it seems evil to you to serve Yahweh, choose today whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> for it is Yahweh our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the middle of whom we passed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve Yahweh; for he is our God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Joshua said to the people, “You can’t serve Yahweh, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God. He will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> If you forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after he has done you good.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve Yahweh.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Yahweh yourselves, to serve him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said, “We are witnesses.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> “Now therefore put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The people said to Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all Yahweh’s words which he spoke to us. It shall be therefore a witness against you, lest you deny your God.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> So Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> After these things, Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Yahweh, that he had worked for Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> They buried the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> They became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Eleazar the son of Aaron died. They buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim. </span> </span>

		<span class="header">1 Corinthians 8</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For though there are things that are called “gods”, whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many “gods” and many “lords”;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forever more, that I don’t cause my brother to stumble. </span> </span>

		<div class="subheader">Proud VS Broken</div>
		<div>
			<div class="subsubheader">Proud</div>
			Proud people have a subconscious feeling, “This ministry/church is privileged to have me and my gifts”; they think of what they can do for God.
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="subsubheader">Broken</div>
			Broken people’s heart attitude is, “I don’t deserve to have a part in any ministry”; they  know that they have nothing to offer God except the life of Jesus flowing through their  broken lives.
