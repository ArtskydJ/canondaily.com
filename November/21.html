		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">44</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks toward the east; and it was shut.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh said to me, “This gate shall be shut. It shall not be opened, no man shall enter in by it; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has entered in by it. Therefore it shall be shut.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> As for the prince, he shall sit in it as prince to eat bread before Yahweh. He shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out the same way.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’s house; so I fell on my face. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I tell you concerning all the ordinances of Yahweh’s house, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every exit of the sanctuary.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> You shall tell the rebellious, even the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “You house of Israel, let that be enough of all your abominations,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add to all your abominations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> You have not performed the duty of my holy things; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The Lord Yahweh says, “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “ ‘ “But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, they will bear their iniquity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house. They shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel. Therefore I have lifted up my hand against them,” says the Lord Yahweh, “and they will bear their iniquity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> They shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they will bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yet I will make them performers of the duty of the house, for all its service, and for all that will be done therein. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “ ‘ “But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who performed the duty of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, shall come near to me to minister to me.

They shall not clothe themselves with anything that makes them sweat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> When they go out into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they minister, and lay them in the holy rooms. They shall put on other garments, that they not sanctify the people with their garments. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> “ ‘ “They shall not shave their heads, or allow their locks to grow long.

For this man does many signs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">48</span> If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">49</span> But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">50</span> nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">51</span> Now he didn’t say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">52</span> and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">53</span> So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">54</span> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">55</span> Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">56</span> Then they sought for Jesus and spoke with one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think—that he isn’t coming to the feast at all?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">57</span> Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him. </span> </span>
