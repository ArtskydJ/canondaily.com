Therefore it shall be shut.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> As for the prince, he shall sit in it as prince to eat bread before Yahweh. He shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out the same way.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’s house; so I fell on my face. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I tell you concerning all the ordinances of Yahweh’s house, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every exit of the sanctuary.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> You shall tell the rebellious, even the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “You house of Israel, let that be enough of all your abominations,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add to all your abominations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> You have not performed the duty of my holy things; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The Lord Yahweh says, “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “ ‘ “But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, they will bear their iniquity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house.

For this man does many signs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">48</span> If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">49</span> But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">50</span> nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">51</span> Now he didn’t say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">52</span> and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">53</span> So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">54</span> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">55</span> Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">56</span> Then they sought for Jesus and spoke with one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think—that he isn’t coming to the feast at all?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">57</span> Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him. </span> </span>
