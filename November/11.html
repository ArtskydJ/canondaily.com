You won’t cover your lips or eat mourner’s bread.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You won’t mourn or weep; but you will pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you will do.

The Lord Yahweh says, “Because you said, ‘Aha!’ against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> therefore, behold, I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession. They will set their encampments in you, and make their dwellings in you. They will eat your fruit and they will drink your milk.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a resting place for flocks. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For the Lord Yahweh says: “Because you have clapped your hands, stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the contempt of your soul against the land of Israel;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand on you, and will deliver you for a plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries. I will destroy you. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “ ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because Moab and Seir say, ‘Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations;’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> to the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> I will execute judgments on Moab. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> “ ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and taken revenge on them;”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> therefore the Lord Yahweh says, “I will stretch out my hand on Edom, and will cut off man and animal from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman. They will fall by the sword even to Dedan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel. They will do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath. Then they will know my vengeance,” says the Lord Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “ ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because the Philistines have taken revenge, and have taken vengeance with contempt of soul to destroy with perpetual hostility;”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> therefore the Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes.

She is broken! She who was the gateway of the peoples has been returned to me. I will be replenished, now that she is laid waste;’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> therefore the Lord Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I am against you, Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> They will destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers. I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the middle of the sea; for I have spoken it,’ says the Lord Yahweh. ‘She will become plunder for the nations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Her daughters who are in the field will be slain with the sword. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “For the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, with chariots, with horsemen, and an army with many people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He will kill your daughters in the field with the sword. He will make forts against you, cast up a mound against you, and raise up the buckler against you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He will set his battering engines against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> By reason of the abundance of his horses, their dust will cover you. Your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen, of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he enters into your gates, as men enter into a city which is broken open.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He will tread down all your streets with the hoofs of his horses. He will kill your people with the sword. The pillars of your strength will go down to the ground.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They will make a plunder of your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise. They will break down your walls, and destroy your pleasant houses. They will lay your stones, your timber, and your dust in the middle of the waters.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> I will cause the noise of your songs to cease. The sound of your harps won’t be heard any more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> I will make you a bare rock. You will be a place for the spreading of nets. You will be built no more; for I Yahweh have spoken it,’ says the Lord Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “The Lord Yahweh says to Tyre: ‘Won’t the islands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made within you?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Then all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling. They will sit on the ground, and will tremble every moment, and be astonished at you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> They will take up a lamentation over you, and tell you, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“How you are destroyed, </span> <span class="line">who were inhabited by seafaring men, </span> <span class="line">the renowned city, </span> <span class="line">who was strong in the sea, </span> <span class="line">she and her inhabitants, </span> <span class="line">who caused their terror to be on all who lived there!” </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">18</span> Now the islands will tremble in the day of your fall. </span> <span class="line">Yes, the islands that are in the sea will be dismayed at your departure.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> “For the Lord Yahweh says: ‘When I make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I bring up the deep on you, and the great waters cover you;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> then I will bring you down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make you dwell in the lower parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with those who go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> I will make you a terror, and you will no more have any being. Though you are sought for, yet you will never be found again,’ says the Lord Yahweh.” </span> </span>
