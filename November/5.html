Behold, twenty-five men were at the door of the gate; and I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses. This is the cauldron, and we are the meat.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh’s Spirit fell on me, and he said to me, “Speak, ‘Yahweh says: “Thus you have said, house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “ ‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Your slain whom you have laid in the middle of it, they are the meat, and this is the cauldron; but you will be brought out of the middle of it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you,” says the Lord Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “I will bring you out of the middle of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> You will fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> This will not be your cauldron, neither will you be the meat in the middle of it. I will judge you in the border of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> You will know that I am Yahweh, for you have not walked in my statutes, You have not executed my ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> When I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your relatives, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Go far away from Yahweh. This land has been given to us for a possession.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “Therefore say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come.” ’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> “Therefore say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> “ ‘They will come there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way on their own heads,’ says the Lord Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them. The glory of the God of Israel was over them above.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh’s glory went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the captives. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">So the vision that I had seen went up from me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Then I spoke to the captives all the things that Yahweh had shown me. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s word also came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Son of man, you dwell in the middle of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and don’t see, who have ears to hear, and don’t hear; for they are a rebellious house. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> “Therefore, you son of man, prepare your stuff for moving, and move by day in their sight. You shall move from your place to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> You shall bring out your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving. You shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as when men go out into exile.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your stuff out that way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> In their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder, and carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face, so that you don’t see the land, for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> I did so as I was commanded. I brought out my stuff by day, as stuff for moving, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought it out in the dark, and bore it on my shoulder in their sight. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> In the morning, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “Son of man, hasn’t the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.” ’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “Say, ‘I am your sign. As I have done, so will it be done to them. They will go into exile, into captivity. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> “ ‘The prince who is among them will bear on his shoulder in the dark, and will go out. They will dig through the wall to carry things out that way. He will cover his face, because he will not see the land with his eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> I will also spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his bands. I will draw out the sword after them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “ ‘They will know that I am Yahweh when I disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> “Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Tell the people of the land, ‘The Lord Yahweh says concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: “They will eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, and all that is therein, because of the violence of all those who dwell therein.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The cities that are inhabited will be laid waste, and the land will be a desolation. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> “Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Tell them therefore, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “I will make this proverb to cease, and they will no more use it as a proverb in Israel;” ’ but tell them, ‘ “The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> For there will be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> For I am Yahweh. I will speak, and the word that I speak will be performed. It will be no more deferred; for in your days, rebellious house, I will speak the word, and will perform it,” says the Lord Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Again Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> “Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, ‘The vision that he sees is for many days to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> “Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “None of my words will be deferred any more, but the word which I speak will be performed,” says the Lord Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span>
