Then he shall go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The burnt offering that the prince shall offer to Yahweh shall be on the Sabbath day six lambs without defect and a ram without defect;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of oil to an ephah.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without defect, and six lambs, and a ram. They shall be without defect.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bull, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> When the prince enters, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go out by its way. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “ ‘ “But when the people of the land come before Yahweh in the appointed feasts, he who enters by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he who enters by the way of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate. He shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go out straight before him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The prince shall go in with them when they go in. When they go out, he shall go out. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “ ‘ “In the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering shall be an ephah </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> When the prince prepares a free will offering, a burnt offering or peace offerings as a free will offering to Yahweh, one shall open for him the gate that looks toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out; and after his going out one shall shut the gate. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> “ ‘ “You shall prepare a lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering to Yahweh daily.

It shall belong to his sons. It is their possession by inheritance.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> But if he gives of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession. He shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people not each be scattered from his possession.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms for the priests, which looked toward the north. Behold, there was a place on the back part westward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the meal offering; that they not bring them out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then he brought me out into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty cubits</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> long and thirty wide. These four in the corners were the same size.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> There was a wall around in them, around the four, and boiling places were made under the walls all around.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Then he said to me, “These are the boiling houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">47</span><span class="verse">1</span> He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters flowed out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the front of the house faced toward the east. The waters came down from underneath, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me around by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looks toward the east. Behold, waters ran out on the right side. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> When the man went out eastward with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the waist.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Afterward he measured one thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters had risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be walked through. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then he said to me, “These waters flow out toward the eastern region, and will go down into the Arabah. Then they will go toward the sea; and flow into the sea which will be made to flow out; and the waters will be healed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> It will happen, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, will live. Then there will be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters have come there, and the waters of the sea will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river comes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> It will happen, that fishermen will stand by it. From En Gedi even to En Eglaim will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish will be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> But the miry places of it, and its marshes, will not be healed. They will be given up to salt.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> By the river on its bank, on this side and on that side, will grow every tree for food, whose leaf won’t wither, neither will its fruit fail. It will produce new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary. Its fruit will be for food, and its leaf for healing.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The Lord Yahweh says: “This shall be the border, by which you shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> You shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore to give it to your fathers. This land will fall to you for inheritance. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “This shall be the border of the land: </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer Hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The border from the sea, shall be Hazar Enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> “The east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border to the east sea you shall measure. This is the east side. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> “The south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth Kadesh, to the brook, to the great sea. This is the south side southward. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> “The west side shall be the great sea, from the south border as far as opposite the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> “So you shall divide this land to yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> It will happen, that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you and to the aliens who live among you, who will father children among you. Then they shall be to you as the native-born among the children of Israel. They shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> It shall happen, that in whatever tribe the stranger lives, there you shall give him his inheritance,” says the Lord Yahweh. </span> </span>
