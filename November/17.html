The cities will be inhabited, and the waste places will be built.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> I will multiply man and animal on you. They will increase and be fruitful. I will cause you to be inhabited as you were before, and you will do better than at your beginnings. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, even my people Israel. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance, and you will never again bereave them of their children.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> “ ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because they say to you, ‘You are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver of your nation;’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> therefore you shall devour men no more, and not bereave your nation any more,” says the Lord Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “I won’t let you hear the shame of the nations any more. You won’t bear the reproach of the peoples any more, and you won’t cause your nation to stumble any more,” says the Lord Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> “Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and by their deeds. Their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. I judged them according to their way and according to their deeds.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, ‘These are Yahweh’s people, and have left his land.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> But I had respect for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “I don’t do this for your sake, house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh,” says the Lord Yahweh, “when I am proven holy in you before their eyes. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> “ ‘ “For I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, and from all your idols.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes. You will keep my ordinances and do them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> You will dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers. You will be my people, and I will be your God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine on you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field, that you may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> “ ‘ “Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> I don’t do this for your sake,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Let it be known to you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, house of Israel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> “ ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited and the waste places will be built.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> The land that was desolate will be tilled instead of being a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> They will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. The waste, desolate, and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Then the nations that are left around you will know that I, Yahweh, have built the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate. I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and I will do it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> “ ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “For this, moreover, I will be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so the waste cities will be filled with flocks of men. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">37</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s hand was on me, and he brought me out in Yahweh’s Spirit, and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He caused me to pass by them all around: and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were very dry.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">I answered, “Lord Yahweh, you know.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Again he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, ‘You dry bones, hear Yahweh’s word.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The Lord Yahweh says to these bones: “Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you will live.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you will live. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> So I prophesied as I was commanded. As I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, there was an earthquake. Then the bones came together, bone to its bone.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost. We are completely cut off.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> You will know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live. Then I will place you in your own land; and you will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it and performed it,” says Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> “You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, ‘For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions.’ Then take another stick, and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then join them for yourself to one another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> “When the children of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Won’t you show us what you mean by these?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in my hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.” ’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they have gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. One king will be king to them all. They will no longer be two nations. They won’t be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> They won’t defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. So they will be my people, and I will be their God. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> “ ‘ “My servant David will be king over them. They all will have one shepherd. They will also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> They will dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers lived. They will dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children, forever. David my servant will be their prince forever.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them. It will be an everlasting covenant with them. I will place them, multiply them, and will set my sanctuary among them forever more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> My tent also will be with them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> The nations will know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is among them forever more.” ’ ” </span> </span>
