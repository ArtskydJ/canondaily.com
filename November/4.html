		<span class="header">Ezekiel 9-10</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near, each man with his destroying weapon in his hand.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand. One man in the middle of them was clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. They went in, and stood beside the bronze altar. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh said to him, “Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done within it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> To the others he said in my hearing, “Go through the city after him, and strike. Don’t let your eye spare, neither have pity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Kill utterly the old man, the young man, the virgin, little children and women; but don’t come near any man on whom is the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then they began at the old men who were before the house. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They went out, and struck in the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> While they were killing, and I was left, I fell on my face, and cried, and said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then he said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perversion; for they say, ‘Yahweh has forsaken the land, and Yahweh doesn’t see.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> As for me also, my eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, “I have done as you have commanded me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, “Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He went in as I watched.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh’s glory mounted up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh’s glory.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The form of a man’s hand appeared here in the cherubim under their wings. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub. The appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> As for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, like a wheel within a wheel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it. They didn’t turn as they went.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Their whole body, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes all around, even the wheels that the four of them had.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “the whirling wheels”.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Every one them had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub. The second face was the face of a man. The third face was the face of a lion. The fourth was the face of an eagle. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also didn’t turn from beside them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> When they stood, these stood. When they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Yahweh’s glory went out from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out, with the wheels beside them. Then they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Every one had four faces, and every one four wings. The likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They each went straight forward. </span> </span>
