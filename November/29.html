Yet we have not entreated the favor of Yahweh our God, that we should turn from our iniquities and have discernment in your truth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore Yahweh has watched over the evil, and brought it on us; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does, and we have not obeyed his voice. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “Now, Lord our God, who has brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have gotten yourself renown, as it is today; we have sinned. We have done wickedly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Lord, according to all your righteousness, let your anger and please let your wrath be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a reproach to all who are around us. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> “Now therefore, our God, listen to the prayer of your servant, and to his petitions, and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> My God, turn your ear, and hear. Open your eyes, and see our desolations, and the city which is called by your name; for we do not present our petitions before you for our righteousness, but for your great mercies’ sake.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Lord, hear. Lord, forgive. Lord, listen and do. Don’t defer, for your own sake, my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Yahweh my God for the holy mountain of my God;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening offering.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> He instructed me and talked with me, and said, Daniel, “I have now come to give you wisdom and understanding.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> At the beginning of your petitions the commandment went out, and I have come to tell you; for you are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> “Seventy weeks are decreed on your people and on your holy city, to finish disobedience, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> “Know therefore and discern that from the going out of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Anointed One,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> the prince, will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. It will be built again, with street and moat, even in troubled times.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> After the sixty-two weeks the Anointed One</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> will be cut off, and will have nothing. The people of the prince who come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end will be with a flood, and war will be even to the end. Desolations are determined.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> He will make a firm covenant with many for one week. In the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease. On the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate; and even to the full end, and that determined, wrath will be poured out on the desolate.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare. He understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> I ate no pleasant bread. No meat or wine came into my mouth. I didn’t anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> In the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, there was a man clothed in linen, whose thighs were adorned with pure gold of Uphaz.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches. His arms and his feet were like burnished bronze. The voice of his words was like the voice of a multitude. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me didn’t see the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> So I was left alone, and saw this great vision. No strength remained in me; for my face grew deathly pale, and I retained no strength.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yet I heard the voice of his words. When I heard the voice of his words, then I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, a hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He said to me, “Daniel, you greatly beloved man, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright; for I have been sent to you, now.” When he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Then he said to me, “Don’t be afraid, Daniel; for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I have come for your words’ sake.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but, behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me because I remained there with the kings of Persia.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for many days.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When he had spoken these words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and was mute.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who stood before me, “My lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows have overtaken me, and I retain no strength.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? For as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me. There was no breath left in me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then one like the appearance of a man touched me again, and he strengthened me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He said, “Greatly beloved man, don’t be afraid. Peace be to you. Be strong. Yes, be strong.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">When he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, “Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. When I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> But I will tell you that which is inscribed in the writing of truth. There is no one who holds with me against these, but Michael your prince. </span> </span>
