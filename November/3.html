		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “You, son of man, the Lord Yahweh says to the land of Israel, ‘An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Now is the end on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your abominations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> My eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your abominations will be among you. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘An evil! A unique evil! Behold, it comes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> An end has come. The end has come! It awakes against you. Behold, it comes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Your doom has come to you, inhabitant of the land! The time has come! The day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, on the mountains.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Now I will shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your abominations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways. Your abominations will be among you. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, strike. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “ ‘Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed. Pride has budded.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them will remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth. There will be nothing of value among them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The time has come! The day draws near. Don’t let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all its multitude.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> For the seller won’t return to that which is sold, although they are still alive; for the vision concerns the whole multitude of it. None will return. None will strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but no one goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all its multitude. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “ ‘The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within. He who is in the field will die by the sword. He who is in the city will be devoured by famine and pestilence.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But those of those who escape, they will escape and will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, everyone in his iniquity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> They will also clothe themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover them. Shame will be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> They will cast their silver in the streets, and their gold will be as an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold won’t be able to deliver them in the day of Yahweh’s wrath. They won’t satisfy their souls or fill their bellies; because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein. Therefore I have made it to them as an unclean thing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a plunder; and they will profane it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> I will also turn my face from them, and they will profane my secret place. Robbers will enter into it, and profane it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> “ ‘Make chains; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I will also make the pride of the strong to cease. Their holy places will be profaned.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Destruction comes! They will seek peace, and there will be none.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Mischief will come on mischief, and rumor will be on rumor. They will seek a vision of the prophet; but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation. The hands of the people of the land will be troubled. I will do to them after their way, and according to their own judgments I will judge them. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, the Lord Yahweh’s hand fell on me there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Then I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his waist and downward, fire; and from his waist and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks toward the north; where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and saw, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they do? Even the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you will again see yet other great abominations.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then he said to me, “Son of man, dig now in the wall.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">When I had dug in the wall, I saw a door. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> So I went in and looked, and saw every form of creeping things, abominable animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around on the wall.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel stood before them. In the middle of them Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan stood, every man with his censer in his hand; and the smell of the cloud of incense went up. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his rooms of imagery? For they say, ‘Yahweh doesn’t see us. Yahweh has forsaken the land.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He said also to me, “You will again see more of the great abominations which they do.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh’s house which was toward the north; and I saw the women sit there weeping for Tammuz.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? You will again see yet greater abominations than these.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He brought me into the inner court of Yahweh’s house; and I saw at the door of Yahweh’s temple, between the porch and the altar, there were about twenty-five men, with their backs toward Yahweh’s temple, and their faces toward the east. They were worshiping the sun toward the east. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger. Behold, they put the branch to their nose.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Therefore I will also deal in wrath. My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them.” </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Again, on the day when the God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great. </span> </span>

He sat down and taught them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the middle,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> they told him, “Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> What then do you say about her?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.” </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> She said, “No one, Lord.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Jesus said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Neither do I condemn you.
