		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed. Then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Daniel spoke and said, “I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the sky broke out on the great sea.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Four great animals came up from the sea, different from one another. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> “The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings. I watched until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a man. A man’s heart was given to it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> “Behold, there was another animal, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. They said this to it: ‘Arise! Devour much flesh!’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> “After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The animal also had four heads; and dominion was given to it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there was a fourth animal, awesome and powerful, and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. It was different from all the animals that were before it. It had ten horns. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> “I watched until thrones were placed, </span> <span class="line">and one who was ancient of days sat. </span> <span class="line">His clothing was white as snow, </span> <span class="line">and the hair of his head like pure wool. </span> <span class="line">His throne was fiery flames, </span> <span class="line">and its wheels burning fire. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> A fiery stream issued and came out from before him. </span> <span class="line">Thousands of thousands ministered to him. </span> <span class="line">Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. </span> <span class="line">The judgment was set. </span> <span class="line">The books were opened. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “I watched at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I watched even until the animal was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> “I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Dominion was given him, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which will not pass away, and his kingdom that which will not be destroyed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved within my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> ‘These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who will arise out of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> “Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal, which was different from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> I saw, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> “Thus he said, ‘The fourth animal will be a fourth kingdom on earth, which will be different from all the kingdoms, and will devour the whole earth, and will tread it down, and break it in pieces.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> As for the ten horns, ten kings will arise out of this kingdom. Another will arise after them; and he will be different from the former, and he will put down three kings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> He will speak words against the Most High, and will wear out the saints of the Most High. He will plan to change the times and the law; and they will be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> “ ‘But the judgment will be set, and they will take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole sky, will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions will serve and obey him.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> “Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my face was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> I saw the vision. Now it was so, that when I saw, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam. I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns. The two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward. No animals could stand before him. There wasn’t any who could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and didn’t touch the ground. The goat had a notable horn between his eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him. There was no one who could deliver the ram out of his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The male goat magnified himself exceedingly. When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of the sky. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Out of one of them came out a little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> It grew great, even to the army of the sky; and it cast down some of the army and of the stars to the ground, and trampled on them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the army; and it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The army was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through disobedience. It cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, “How long will the vision about the continual burnt offering, and the disobedience that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the army to be trodden under foot be?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He said to me, “To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary will be cleansed.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. Then behold, there stood before me something like the appearance of a man.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face; but he said to me, “Understand, son of man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He said, “Behold, I will make you know what will be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The rough male goat is the king of Greece. The great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> As for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms will stand up out of the nation, but not with his power. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> “In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce face, and understanding dark sentences, will stand up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> His power will be mighty, but not by his own power. He will destroy awesomely, and will prosper in what he does. He will destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Through his policy he will cause deceit to prosper in his hand. He will magnify himself in his heart, and he will destroy many in their security. He will also stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be broken without hand. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> “The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but seal up the vision, for it belongs to many days to come.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick for some days. Then I rose up, and did the king’s business. I wondered at the vision, but no one understood it. </span> </span>
