		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> In the fifth of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh’s</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> word came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and Yahweh’s hand was there on him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> I looked, and behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness around it, and out of the middle of it as it were glowing metal, out of the middle of the fire.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Out of its center came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Their feet were straight feet. The sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. The four of them had their faces and their wings like this:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Their wings were joined to one another. They didn’t turn when they went. Each one went straight forward. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. The four of them had the face of a lion on the right side. The four of them had the face of an ox on the left side. The four of them also had the face of an eagle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of each one touched another, and two covered their bodies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Each one went straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went. They didn’t turn when they went.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. The fire went up and down among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and lightning went out of the fire.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. The four of them had one likeness. Their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn when they went.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. When the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Wherever the spirit was to go, they went. The spirit was to go there. The wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When those went, these went. When those stood, these stood. When those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like an awesome crystal to look at, stretched out over their heads above.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Under the expanse, their wings were straight, one toward the other. Each one had two which covered on this side, and each one had two which covered their bodies on that side.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army. When they stood, they let down their wings. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> stone. On the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all around, from the appearance of his waist and upward; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">This was the appearance of the likeness of Yahweh’s glory. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The children are impudent and stiff-hearted. I am sending you to them, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> Yahweh says.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> They, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse, for they are a rebellious house, yet they will know that there has been a prophet among them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> You, son of man, don’t be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you dwell among scorpions. Don’t be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse; for they are most rebellious.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But you, son of man, hear what I tell you. Don’t be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me; and, behold, a scroll of a book was in it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He spread it before me. It was written within and without; and lamentations, mourning, and woe were written in it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He said to me, “Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then I ate it; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can’t understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen to me; for all the house of Israel are obstinate</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and hard-hearted.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> I have made your forehead as a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, receive in your heart and hear with your ears all my words that I speak to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Go to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahweh says,’ whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, “Blessed be Yahweh’s glory from his place.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and Yahweh’s hand was strong on me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> At the end of seven days, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> “Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> When I tell the wicked, ‘You will surely die;’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; that wicked man will die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn’t turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> “Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he will die. Because you have not given him warning, he will die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered; but I will require his blood at your hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Yahweh’s hand was there on me; and he said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, and I will talk with you there.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Then I arose, and went out into the plain, and behold, Yahweh’s glory stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar. Then I fell on my face. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet. He spoke with me, and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> But you, son of man, behold, they will put ropes on you, and will bind you with them, and you will not go out among them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you will be mute, and will not be able to correct them; for they are a rebellious house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahweh says.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.” </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and turned away from evil.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> Satan also came among them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh.  </span>

For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of David, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and from Bethlehem,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> the village where David was?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> So a division arose in the multitude because of him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.  </span>
