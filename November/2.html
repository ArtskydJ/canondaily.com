So you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> “Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have appointed forty days, each day for a year, to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, I put ropes on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “Take for yourself also wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel.

Then they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> They will know that I am Yahweh. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.” ’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas!” Because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they will fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He who is far off will die of the pestilence. He who is near will fall by the sword. He who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath on them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> You will know that I am Yahweh, when their slain men are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered pleasant aroma to all their idols.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> I will stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations.
