		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> A revelation, Yahweh’s</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> word to Israel by Malachi. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “I have loved you,” says Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Yet you say, “How have you loved us?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“Wasn’t Esau Jacob’s brother?” says Yahweh, “Yet I loved Jacob;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Whereas Edom says, “We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places;” Yahweh of Armies says, “They shall build, but I will throw down; and men will call them ‘The Wicked Land,’ even the people against whom Yahweh shows wrath forever.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Your eyes will see, and you will say, “Yahweh is great—even beyond the border of Israel!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> “A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, then where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? Says Yahweh of Armies to you, priests, who despise my name. You say, ‘How have we despised your name?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ In that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is contemptible.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn’t that evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn’t that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will he be pleased with you? Or will he accept your person?” says Yahweh of Armies. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “Now, please entreat the favor of God,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> that he may be gracious to us. With this, will he accept any of you?” says Yahweh of Armies. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “neither will I accept an offering at your hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For from the rising of the sun even to its going down, my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the nations,” says Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> “But you profane it, in that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> You say also, ‘Behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> what a weariness it is!’ and you have sniffed at it”, says Yahweh of Armies; “and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at your hand?” says Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> “But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> a defective thing; for I am a great King,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and my name is awesome among the nations.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> If you will not listen, and if you will not take it to heart, to give glory to my name,” says Yahweh of Armies, “then I will send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not take it to heart.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, I will rebuke your offspring,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> You will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> “My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent toward me, and stood in awe of my name.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But you have turned away from the path. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “Therefore I have also made you contemptible and wicked before all the people, according to the way you have not kept my ways, but have had respect for persons in the law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Don’t we all have one father? Hasn’t one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes and him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> This again you do: you cover Yahweh’s altar with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, because he doesn’t regard the offering any more, neither receives it with good will at your hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yet you say, ‘Why?’ Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Did he not make you one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? Why one? He sought godly offspring. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> One who hates and divorces”, says Yahweh, the God of Israel, “covers his garment with violence!” says Yahweh of Armies. “Therefore pay attention to your spirit, that you don’t be unfaithful.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> You have wearied Yahweh with your words. Yet you say, ‘How have we wearied him?’ In that you say, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in Yahweh’s sight, and he delights in them;’ or ‘Where is the God of justice?’ </span> </span>
