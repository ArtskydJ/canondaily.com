for we don’t fear Yahweh; </span> <span class="line">and the king, what can he do for us?” </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants. </span> <span class="line">Therefore judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> The inhabitants of Samaria will be in terror for the calves of Beth Aven; </span> <span class="line">for its people will mourn over it, </span> <span class="line">Along with its priests who rejoiced over it, </span> <span class="line">for its glory, because it has departed from it. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king. </span> <span class="line">Ephraim will receive shame, </span> <span class="line">and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> Samaria and her king float away, </span> <span class="line">like a twig on the water. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed. </span> <span class="line">The thorn and the thistle will come up on their altars. </span> <span class="line">They will tell the mountains, “Cover us!” and the hills, “Fall on us!” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> “Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah. </span> <span class="line">There they remained. </span> <span class="line">The battle against the children of iniquity doesn’t overtake them in Gibeah. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> When it is my desire, I will chastise them; </span> <span class="line">and the nations will be gathered against them, </span> <span class="line">when they are bound to their two transgressions. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh; </span> <span class="line">so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck. </span> <span class="line">I will set a rider on Ephraim. </span> <span class="line">Judah will plow. </span> <span class="line">Jacob will break his clods. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> Sow to yourselves in righteousness, </span> <span class="line">reap according to kindness. </span> <span class="line">Break up your fallow ground;

</span> <span class="line">but they didn’t know that I healed them. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love; </span> <span class="line">and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks; </span> <span class="line">and I bent down to him and I fed him. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> “They won’t return into the land of Egypt; </span> <span class="line">but the Assyrian will be their king, </span> <span class="line">because they refused to repent. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> The sword will fall on their cities, </span> <span class="line">and will destroy the bars of their gates, </span> <span class="line">and will put an end to their plans. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> My people are determined to turn from me. </span> <span class="line">Though they call to the Most High, </span> <span class="line">he certainly won’t exalt them. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> “How can I give you up, Ephraim? </span> <span class="line">How can I hand you over, Israel? </span> <span class="line">How can I make you like Admah? </span> <span class="line">How can I make you like Zeboiim? </span> <span class="line">My heart is turned within me, </span> <span class="line">my compassion is aroused. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> I will not execute the fierceness of my anger. </span> <span class="line">I will not return to destroy Ephraim: </span> <span class="line">for I am God, and not man;

</span> <span class="line">for he will roar, and the children will come trembling from the west. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt, </span> <span class="line">and like a dove out of the land of Assyria; </span> <span class="line">and I will settle them in their houses,” says Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, </span> <span class="line">and the house of Israel with deceit. </span> <span class="line">Judah still strays from God, </span> <span class="line">and is unfaithful to the Holy One. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Ephraim feeds on wind, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">and chases the east wind. </span> <span class="line">He continually multiplies lies and desolation. </span> <span class="line">They make a covenant with Assyria, </span> <span class="line">and oil is carried into Egypt. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh also has a controversy with Judah, </span> <span class="line">and will punish Jacob according to his ways; </span> <span class="line">according to his deeds he will repay him. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> In the womb he took his brother by the heel; </span> <span class="line">and in his manhood he contended with God. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> Indeed, he struggled with the angel, and prevailed; </span> <span class="line">he wept, and made supplication to him. </span> <span class="line">He found him at Bethel, and there he spoke with us, </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> even Yahweh, the God of Armies; </span> <span class="line">Yahweh is his name of renown! </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore turn to your God. </span> <span class="line">Keep kindness and justice, </span> <span class="line">and wait continually for your God. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> A merchant has dishonest scales in his hand. </span> <span class="line">He loves to defraud. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> Ephraim said, “Surely I have become rich, </span> <span class="line">I have found myself wealth. </span> <span class="line">In all my wealth they won’t find in me any iniquity that is sin.” </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> “But I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt. </span> <span class="line">I will yet again make you dwell in tents, </span> <span class="line">as in the days of the solemn feast. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> I have also spoken to the prophets, </span> <span class="line">and I have multiplied visions; </span> <span class="line">and by the ministry of the prophets I have used parables. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> If Gilead is wicked, </span> <span class="line">surely they are worthless. </span> <span class="line">In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls. </span> <span class="line">Indeed, their altars are like heaps in the furrows of the field. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> Jacob fled into the country of Aram, </span> <span class="line">and Israel served to get a wife, </span> <span class="line">and for a wife he tended flocks and herds. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">13</span> By a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up out of Egypt, </span> <span class="line">and by a prophet he was preserved. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> Ephraim has bitterly provoked anger. </span> <span class="line">Therefore his blood will be left on him, </span> <span class="line">and his Lord</span> <span class="line"> will repay his contempt. </span> </span>
