		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> She didn’t obey the voice. She didn’t receive correction. She didn’t trust in Yahweh. She didn’t draw near to her God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Her princes within her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh, within her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn’t fail, but the unjust know no shame.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> I said, “Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling won’t be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her.” But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “Therefore wait for me”, says Yahweh, “until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on Yahweh’s name, to serve him shoulder to shoulder.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings, in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will take away out from among you your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be arrogant in my holy mountain.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But I will leave among you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in Yahweh’s name.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh has taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is among you. You will not be afraid of evil any more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, “Don’t be afraid, Zion. Don’t let your hands be weak.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh, your God, is among you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you, and I will save those who are lame, and gather those who were driven away. I will give them praise and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> At that time I will bring you in, and at that time I will gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says Yahweh. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast, and who worshiped his image. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man. Every living thing in the sea died. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I heard the angel of the waters saying, “You are righteous, who are and who were, O Holy One, because you have judged these things.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve this.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> I heard the altar saying, “Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to him to scorch men with fire.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> People were scorched with great heat, and people blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues. They didn’t repent and give him glory. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues because of the pain,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores. They didn’t repent of their works. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like frogs;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which go out to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them together for the war of that great day of God, the Almighty. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “Behold, I come like a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his clothes, so that he doesn’t walk naked, and they see his shame.” </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew, “Megiddo”. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The seventh poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, “It is done!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> There were lightnings, sounds, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as has not happened since there were men on the earth, so great an earthquake, and so mighty.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Great hailstones, about the weight of a talent,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> came down out of the sky on people. People blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for this plague is exceedingly severe. </span> </span>
