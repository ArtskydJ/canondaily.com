		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> word which came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> I will utterly sweep away everything from the surface of the earth, says Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> I will sweep away man and animal. I will sweep away the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and the heaps of rubble with the wicked. I will cut off man from the surface of the earth, says Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> I will stretch out my hand against Judah, and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place: the name of the idolatrous and pagan priests,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> those who worship the army of the sky on the housetops, those who worship and swear by Yahweh and also swear by Malcam,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> those who have turned back from following Yahweh, and those who haven’t sought Yahweh nor inquired after him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Be silent at the presence of the Lord</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> Yahweh, for the day of Yahweh is at hand. For Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice. He has consecrated his guests.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> It will happen in the day of Yahweh’s sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, the king’s sons, and all those who are clothed with foreign clothing.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> In that day, I will punish all those who leap over the threshold, who fill their master’s house with violence and deceit.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> In that day, says Yahweh, there will be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan are undone! All those who were loaded with silver are cut off.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> It will happen at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are settled on their dregs, who say in their heart, “Yahweh will not do good, neither will he do evil.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Their wealth will become a plunder, and their houses a desolation. Yes, they will build houses, but won’t inhabit them. They will plant vineyards, but won’t drink their wine.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The great day of Yahweh is near. It is near, and hurries greatly, the voice of the day of Yahweh. The mighty man cries there bitterly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> I will bring distress on men, that they will walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Yahweh, and their blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them in the day of Yahweh’s wrath, but the whole land will be devoured by the fire of his jealousy; for he will make an end, yes, a terrible end, of all those who dwell in the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together, you nation that has no shame,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> before the appointed time when the day passes as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Yahweh comes on you, before the day of Yahweh’s anger comes on you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Seek Yahweh, all you humble of the land, who have kept his ordinances. Seek righteousness. Seek humility. It may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yahweh’s anger.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For Gaza will be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation. They will drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron will be rooted up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! Yahweh’s word is against you, Canaan, the land of the Philistines. I will destroy you, that there will be no inhabitant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The sea coast will be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah. They will find pasture. In the houses of Ashkelon, they will lie down in the evening, for Yahweh, their God,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> will visit them, and restore them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the insults of the children of Ammon, with which they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore as I live, says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, surely Moab will be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and salt pits, and a perpetual desolation. The remnant of my people will plunder them, and the survivors of my nation will inherit them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> This they will have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh will be awesome to them, for he will famish all the gods of the land. Men will worship him, everyone from his place, even all the shores of the nations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> You Cushites also, you will be killed by my sword.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He will stretch out his hand against the north, destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, as dry as the wilderness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Herds will lie down in the middle of her, all the animals of the nations. Both the pelican and the porcupine will lodge in its capitals. Their calls will echo through the windows. Desolation will be in the thresholds, for he has laid bare the cedar beams.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> This is the joyous city that lived carelessly, that said in her heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me.” How she has become a desolation, a place for animals to lie down in! Everyone who passes by her will hiss, and shake their fists. </span> </span>
