		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> word that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> When Yahweh spoke at first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a wife of prostitution and children of unfaithfulness; for the land commits great adultery, forsaking Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh said to him, “Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> It will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> She conceived again, and bore a daughter. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then he said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah</span> <span class="paragraphtext">; for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahweh their God,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi</span> <span class="paragraphtext">; for you are not my people, and I will not be yours.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can’t be measured or counted; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Say to your brothers, ‘My people!’</span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">and to your sisters, ‘My loved one!’</span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">2</span> Contend with your mother! </span> <span class="line">Contend, for she is not my wife, </span> <span class="line">neither am I her husband; </span> <span class="line">and let her put away her prostitution from her face, </span> <span class="line">and her adulteries from between her breasts; </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> Lest I strip her naked, </span> <span class="line">and make her bare as in the day that she was born, </span> <span class="line">and make her like a wilderness, </span> <span class="line">and set her like a dry land, </span> <span class="line">and kill her with thirst. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy; </span> <span class="line">for they are children of unfaithfulness; </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> For their mother has played the prostitute. </span> <span class="line">She who conceived them has done shamefully; </span> <span class="line">for she said, ‘I will go after my lovers, </span> <span class="line">who give me my bread and my water, </span> <span class="line">my wool and my flax, </span> <span class="line">my oil and my drink.’ </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore behold,</span> <span class="line"> I will hedge up your way with thorns, </span> <span class="line">and I will build a wall against her, </span> <span class="line">that she can’t find her way. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> She will follow after her lovers, </span> <span class="line">but she won’t overtake them; </span> <span class="line">and she will seek them, </span> <span class="line">but won’t find them. </span> <span class="line">Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband; </span> <span class="line">for then was it better with me than now.’ </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> For she didn’t know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil, </span> <span class="line">and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, </span> <span class="line">and my new wine in its season, </span> <span class="line">and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">10</span> Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, </span> <span class="line">and no one will deliver her out of my hand. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> I will also cause all her celebrations to cease: </span> <span class="line">her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, </span> <span class="line">about which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me;

</span> <span class="line">and you shall know Yahweh. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">21</span> It will happen in that day, I will respond,” says Yahweh, </span> <span class="line">“I will respond to the heavens, </span> <span class="line">and they will respond to the earth; </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">22</span> and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; </span> <span class="line">and they will respond to Jezreel. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">23</span> I will sow her to me in the earth; </span> <span class="line">and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy; </span> <span class="line">and I will tell those who were not my people, ‘You are my people;’ </span> <span class="line">and they will say, ‘My God!’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to me, “Go again, love a woman loved by another, and an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and a half of barley.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> I said to her, “You shall stay with me many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be with any other man. I will also be so toward you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> For the children of Israel shall live many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without sacred stone, and without ephod or idols.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Afterward the children of Israel shall return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king, and shall come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days. </span> </span>
