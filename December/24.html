And the prophets, do they live forever?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, didn’t they overtake your fathers? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“Then they repented and said, ‘Just as Yahweh of Armies determined to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our practices, so he has dealt with us.’ ”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, Yahweh’s word came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “I had a vision in the night, and behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in a ravine; and behind him there were red, brown, and white horses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then I asked, ‘My lord, what are these?’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The angel who talked with me said to me, “I will show you what these are.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The man who stood among the myrtle trees answered, “They are the ones Yahweh has sent to go back and forth through the earth.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> They reported to Yahweh’s angel who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, “We have walked back and forth through the earth, and behold, all the earth is at rest and in peace.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Then Yahweh’s angel replied, “O Yahweh of Armies, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these seventy years?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh answered the angel who talked with me with kind and comforting words.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> So the angel who talked with me said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, but they added to the calamity.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore Yahweh says: “I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy. My house shall be built in it,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and a line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.” ’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> “Proclaim further, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and Yahweh will again comfort Zion, and will again choose Jerusalem.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four horns.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He answered me, “These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh showed me four craftsmen.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Then I asked, “What are these coming to do?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head; but these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Then I asked, “Where are you going?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> and said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> For I,’ says Yahweh, ‘will be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory in the middle of her.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,’ says Yahweh; ‘for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky,’ says Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> ‘Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For Yahweh of Armies says: ‘For honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a plunder to those who served them; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for, behold, I come, and I will dwell within you,’ says Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell among you, and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Be silent, all flesh, before Yahweh; for he has roused himself from his holy habitation!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before Yahweh’s angel, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh said to Satan, “Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take the filthy garments off him.” To him he said, “Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and Yahweh’s angel was standing by.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh’s angel protested to Joshua, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “Yahweh of Armies says: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will follow my instructions, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, behold, I will bring out my servant, the Branch.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave its engraving,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> In that day,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.’ ” </span> </span>
