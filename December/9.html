A crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Another came out: a red horse. To him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. There was given to him a great sword. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come and see!” And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> I heard a voice in the middle of the four living creatures saying, “A choenix </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! Don’t damage the oil and the wine!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying, “Come and see!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, a pale horse, and the name of he who sat on it was Death. Hades </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> followed with him. Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the testimony of the Lamb which they had.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> They cried with a loud voice, saying, “How long, Master, the holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> A long white robe was given to each of them.
