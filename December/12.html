Indeed we must not mention Yahweh’s name.’ </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> “For, behold, Yahweh commands, and the great house will be smashed to pieces, </span> <span class="line">and the little house into bits. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> Do horses run on the rocky crags? </span> <span class="line">Does one plow there with oxen? </span> <span class="line">But you have turned justice into poison, </span> <span class="line">and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness; </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">13</span> you who rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say, </span> <span class="line">‘Haven’t we taken for ourselves horns by our own strength?’ </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, house of Israel,” </span> <span class="line">says Yahweh, the God of Armies; </span> <span class="line">“and they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: and behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and behold, it was the latter growth after the king’s harvest.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> When they finished eating the grass of the land, then I said, “Lord Yahweh, forgive, I beg you! How could Jacob stand? For he is small.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh relented concerning this. “It shall not be,” says Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me and behold, the Lord Yahweh called for judgment by fire; and it dried up the great deep, and would have devoured the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then I said, “Lord Yahweh, stop, I beg you! How could Jacob stand? For he is small.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh relented concerning this. “This also shall not be,” says the Lord Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Thus he showed me and behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh said to me, “Amos, what do you see?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">I said, “A plumb line.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then the Lord said, “Behold, I will set a plumb line in the middle of my people Israel. I will not again pass by them any more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The high places of Isaac will be desolate, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the middle of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For Amos says, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Amaziah also said to Amos, “You seer, go, flee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> but don’t prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a farmer of sycamore figs;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> and Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Now therefore listen to Yahweh’s word: ‘You say, Don’t prophesy against Israel, and don’t preach against the house of Isaac.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore Yahweh says: ‘Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you yourself shall die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’ ” </span> </span>
