Indeed we must not mention Yahweh’s name.’ </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">11</span> “For, behold, Yahweh commands, and the great house will be smashed to pieces, </span> <span class="line">and the little house into bits. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">12</span> Do horses run on the rocky crags? </span> <span class="line">Does one plow there with oxen? </span> <span class="line">But you have turned justice into poison, </span> <span class="line">and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness; </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">13</span> you who rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say, </span> <span class="line">‘Haven’t we taken for ourselves horns by our own strength?’ </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, house of Israel,” </span> <span class="line">says Yahweh, the God of Armies; </span> <span class="line">“and they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: and behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and behold, it was the latter growth after the king’s harvest.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> When they finished eating the grass of the land, then I said, “Lord Yahweh, forgive, I beg you!

How could Jacob stand? For he is small.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh relented concerning this. “This also shall not be,” says the Lord Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Thus he showed me and behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh said to me, “Amos, what do you see?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">I said, “A plumb line.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then the Lord said, “Behold, I will set a plumb line in the middle of my people Israel.

The land is not able to bear all his words.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> For Amos says, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Amaziah also said to Amos, “You seer, go, flee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> but don’t prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a farmer of sycamore figs;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> and Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Now therefore listen to Yahweh’s word: ‘You say, Don’t prophesy against Israel, and don’t preach against the house of Isaac.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore Yahweh says: ‘Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you yourself shall die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’ ” </span> </span>
