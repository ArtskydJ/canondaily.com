Before Zerubbabel you are a plain; and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of ‘Grace, grace, to it!’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Indeed, who despises the day of small things? For these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. These are Yahweh’s eyes, which run back and forth through the whole earth.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then I asked him, “What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lamp stand and on the left side of it?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> I asked him the second time, “What are these two olive branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that pour the golden oil out of themselves?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He answered me, “Don’t you know what these are?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">I said, “No, my lord.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of the whole earth.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a flying scroll.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He said to me, “What do you see?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">I answered, “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and its width ten cubits.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the surface of the whole land; for everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it on the one side; and everyone who swears falsely shall be cut off according to it on the other side.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> I will cause it to go out,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by my name; and it will remain in the middle of his house, and will destroy it with its timber and its stones.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then the angel who talked with me came forward, and said to me, “Lift up now your eyes, and see what this is that is appearing.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> I said, “What is it?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “This is the ephah</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> basket that is appearing.” He said moreover, “This is their appearance in all the land  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> (and behold, a talent</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of lead was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting in the middle of the ephah</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> basket.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He said, “This is Wickedness;” and he threw her down into the middle of the ephah basket; and he threw the weight of lead on its mouth. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, there were two women, and the wind was in their wings. Now they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah basket between earth and the sky.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Then I said to the angel who talked with me, “Where are these carrying the ephah basket?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> He said to me, “To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bronze.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> In the first chariot were red horses; in the second chariot black horses;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot dappled horses, all of them powerful.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The angel answered me, “These are the four winds of the sky, which go out from standing before the Lord of all the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The one with the black horses goes out toward the north country; and the white went out after them; and the dappled went out toward the south country.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The strong went out, and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth: and he said, “Go around and through the earth!” So they walked back and forth through the earth. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> “Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yes, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> and speak to him, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build Yahweh’s temple;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> even he shall build Yahweh’s temple; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in Yahweh’s temple.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Those who are far off shall come and build in Yahweh’s temple; and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you. This will happen, if you will diligently obey Yahweh your God’s voice.” ’ ”</span> </span>
