		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, then threw it on the earth. Thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake followed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burned up, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and one third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The name of the star is called “Wormwood.” One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn’t shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> I saw, and I heard an eagle,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, “Woe!
