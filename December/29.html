I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> It will happen that, when anyone still prophesies, then his father and his mother who bore him will tell him, ‘You must die, because you speak lies in Yahweh’s name;’ and his father and his mother who bore him will stab him when he prophesies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> It will happen in that day, that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision, when he prophesies; neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> but he will say, ‘I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> One will say to him, ‘What are these wounds between your arms?’ Then he will answer, ‘Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.’ </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> “Awake, sword, against my shepherd, </span> <span class="line">and against the man who is close to me,” says Yahweh of Armies. </span> <span class="line">“Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered; </span> <span class="line">and I will turn my hand against the little ones. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> It shall happen that in all the land,” says Yahweh, </span> <span class="line">“two parts in it will be cut off and die; </span> <span class="line">but the third will be left in it. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> I will bring the third part into the fire, </span> <span class="line">and will refine them as silver is refined, </span> <span class="line">and will test them like gold is tested. </span> <span class="line">They will call on my name, and I will hear them. </span> <span class="line">I will say, ‘It is my people;’ </span> <span class="line">and they will say, ‘Yahweh is my God.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, a day of Yahweh comes, when your plunder will be divided within you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city will be taken, the houses rifled, and the women ravished. Half of the city will go out into captivity, and the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Then Yahweh will go out and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in two, from east to west, making a very great valley. Half of the mountain will move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> You shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azel; yes, you shall flee, just like you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Yahweh my God will come, and all the holy ones with you.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> It will happen in that day, that there will not be light, cold, or frost.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> It will be a unique day which is known to Yahweh; not day, and not night; but it will come to pass, that at evening time there will be light. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> It will happen in that day, that living waters will go out from Jerusalem: half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea. It will be so in summer and in winter. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh will be King over all the earth. In that day Yahweh will be one, and his name one.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> All the land will be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will be lifted up, and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king’s wine presses.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Men will dwell therein, and there will be no more curse; but Jerusalem will dwell safely.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> This will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike all the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem: their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will consume away in their sockets, and their tongue will consume away in their mouth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> It will happen in that day, that a great panic from Yahweh will be among them; and they will each hold onto the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together: gold, and silver, and clothing, in great abundance. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> A plague like this will fall on the horse, on the mule, on the camel, on the donkey, and on all the animals that will be in those camps.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> It will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Yahweh of Armies, and to keep the feast of booths.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> It will be, that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn’t go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Yahweh of Armies, on them there will be no rain.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> If the family of Egypt doesn’t go up, and doesn’t come, neither will it rain on them. This will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike the nations that don’t go up to keep the feast of booths.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that don’t go up to keep the feast of booths.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> In that day there will be on the bells of the horses, “HOLY TO YAHWEH”; and the pots in Yahweh’s house will be like the bowls before the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Yahweh of Armies; and all those who sacrifice will come and take of them, and cook in them. In that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of Yahweh of Armies. </span> </span>
