You eat, but you don’t have enough. You drink, but you aren’t filled with drink. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm, and he who earns wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes in it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> This is what Yahweh of Armies says: “Consider your ways.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build the house. I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified,” says Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> “You looked for much, and, behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why?” says Yahweh of Armies, “Because of my house that lies waste, while each of you is busy with his own house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on that which the ground produces, on men, on livestock, and on all the labor of the hands.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed Yahweh, their God’s</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> voice, and the words of Haggai, the prophet, as Yahweh, their God, had sent him; and the people feared Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then Haggai, Yahweh’s messenger, spoke Yahweh’s message to the people, saying, “I am with you,” says Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of Yahweh of Armies, their God,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> in the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came by Haggai the prophet, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> ‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn’t it in your eyes as nothing?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ says Yahweh. ‘Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ says Yahweh, ‘and work, for I am with you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. ‘Don’t be afraid.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For this is what Yahweh of Armies says: ‘Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> and I will shake all nations. The precious things of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,’ says Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> ‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says Yahweh of Armies; ‘and in this place I will give peace,’ says Yahweh of Armies.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, Yahweh’s word came by Haggai the prophet, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> “Yahweh of Armies says: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> ‘If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it become holy?’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The priests answered, “No.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The priests answered, “It will be unclean.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Then Haggai answered, “ ‘So is this people, and so is this nation before me,’ says Yahweh; ‘and so is every work of their hands. That which they offer there is unclean.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in Yahweh’s temple.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you didn’t turn to me,’ says Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> ‘Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of Yahweh’s temple was laid, consider it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven’t produced. From today I will bless you.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh’s word came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> “Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, ‘I will shake the heavens and the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. The horses and their riders will come down, everyone by the sword of his brother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> In that day, says Yahweh of Armies, I will take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,’ says Yahweh, ‘and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.” </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, “Come here. I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality. Those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> And on her forehead a name was written, “MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The angel said to me, “Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go into destruction. Those who dwell on the earth and whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel when they see that the beast was, and is not, and shall be present.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> They are seven kings. Five have fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must continue a little while.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings, and those who are with him are called chosen and faithful.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He said to me, “The waters which you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, will make her desolate, will strip her naked, will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.” </span> </span>
