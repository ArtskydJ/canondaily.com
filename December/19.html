		<span class="header">Nahum 1-3</span>
		
		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> A revelation about Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> is a jealous God</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and avenges. Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath. Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he maintains wrath against his enemies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. Yahweh has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan languishes, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languishes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, yes, the world, and all who dwell in it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knows those who take refuge in him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> What do you plot against Yahweh? He will make a full end. Affliction won’t rise up the second time.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly like dry stubble.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> There is one gone out of you, who devises evil against Yahweh, who counsels wickedness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh says: “Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so they will be cut down, and he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Now I will break his yoke from off you, and will burst your bonds apart.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh has commanded concerning you: “No more descendants will bear your name. Out of the house of your gods, I will cut off the engraved image and the molten image. I will make your grave, for you are vile.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace! Keep your feasts, Judah! Perform your vows, for the wicked one will no more pass through you. He is utterly cut off. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> He who dashes in pieces has come up against you. Keep the fortress! Watch the way! Strengthen your waist! Fortify your power mightily!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> For Yahweh restores the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the destroyers have destroyed them, and ruined their vine branches.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The shield of his mighty men is made red. The valiant men are in scarlet. The chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the pine spears are brandished.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The chariots rage in the streets. They rush back and forth in the wide ways. Their appearance is like torches. They run like the lightnings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He summons his picked troops. They stumble on their way. They dash to its wall, and the protective shield is put in place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> It is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her servants moan as with the voice of doves, beating on their breasts.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water, yet they flee away. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one looks back.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Take the plunder of silver. Take the plunder of gold, for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> She is empty, void, and waste. The heart melts, the knees knock together, their bodies and faces have grown pale.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked, the lion’s cubs, and no one made them afraid?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with the kill, and his dens with prey.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> “Behold, I am against you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions; and I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies and robbery. The prey doesn’t depart.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The noise of the whip, the noise of the rattling of wheels, prancing horses, and bounding chariots,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies. They stumble on their bodies,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> because of the multitude of the prostitution of the alluring prostitute, the mistress of witchcraft, who sells nations through her prostitution, and families through her witchcraft.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> “Behold, I am against you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> I will throw abominable filth on you, and make you vile, and will set you a spectacle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> It will happen that all those who look at you will flee from you, and say, ‘Nineveh is laid waste! Who will mourn for her?’ Where will I seek comforters for you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Are you better than No-Amon,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> who was situated among the rivers, who had the waters around her; whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength. Put and Libya were her helpers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yet was she carried away. She went into captivity. Her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets, and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> You also will be drunken. You will be hidden. You also will seek a stronghold because of the enemy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> All your fortresses will be like fig trees with the first-ripe figs: if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, your troops among you are women. The gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies. The fire has devoured your bars.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Draw water for the siege. Strengthen your fortresses. Go into the clay, and tread the mortar. Make the brick kiln strong.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> There the fire will devour you. The sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the grasshopper. Multiply like grasshoppers. Multiply like the locust.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the skies. The grasshopper strips, and flees away.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Your guards are like the locusts, and your officials like the swarms of locusts, which settle on the walls on a cold day, but when the sun appears, they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Your shepherds slumber, king of Assyria. Your nobles lie down. Your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no one to gather them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> There is no healing your wound, for your injury is fatal. All who hear the report of you clap their hands over you; for who hasn’t felt your endless cruelty? </span> </span>

The sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins.
