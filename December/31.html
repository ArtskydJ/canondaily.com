		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, behold, he comes!” says Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like launderers’ soap;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the perjurers, and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and who deprive the foreigner of justice, and don’t fear me,” says Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> “For I, Yahweh, don’t change; therefore you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> From the days of your fathers you have turned away from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says Yahweh of Armies. “But you say, ‘How shall we return?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me! But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In tithes and offerings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> You are cursed with the curse; for you rob me, even this whole nation.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and test me now in this,” says Yahweh of Armies, “if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there will not be room enough for.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field,” says Yahweh of Armies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> “All nations shall call you blessed, for you will be a delightful land,” says Yahweh of Armies. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> “Your words have been stout against me,” says Yahweh. “Yet you say, ‘What have we spoken against you?’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God;’ and ‘What profit is it that we have followed his instructions, and that we have walked mournfully before Yahweh of Armies?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of memory was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh, and who honored his name.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> They shall be mine,” says Yahweh of Armies, “my own possession in the day that I make, and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who doesn’t serve him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> “For, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all who work wickedness, will be stubble; and the day that comes will burn them up,” says Yahweh of Armies, “that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings. You will go out, and leap like calves of the stall.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> You shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make,” says Yahweh of Armies. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> “Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.” </span> </span>

Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and everyone a ring of gold. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He had also seven sons and three daughters.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> So Job died, being old and full of days. </span> </span>

This was the disciple whom Jesus loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus’ breast at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Jesus said to him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> This saying therefore went out among the brothers,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> that this disciple wouldn’t die. Yet Jesus didn’t say to him that he wouldn’t die, but, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself wouldn’t have room for the books that would be written. </span> </span>

The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> There will be no curse any more. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will serve him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> There will be no night, and they need no lamp light or sun light; for the Lord God will illuminate them.

I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers, the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book.
