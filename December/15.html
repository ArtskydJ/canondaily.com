		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Yahweh’s</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> word came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach against it, for their wickedness has come up before me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh. He went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid its fare, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> But Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a mighty storm on the sea, so that the ship was likely to break up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then the mariners were afraid, and every man cried to his god. They threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone down into the innermost parts of the ship, and he was laying down, and was fast asleep.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> So the ship master came to him, and said to him, “What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your God!</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> Maybe your God</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> will notice us, so that we won’t perish.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> They all said to each other, “Come! Let’s cast lots, that we may know who is responsible for this evil that is on us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then they asked him, “Tell us, please, for whose cause this evil is on us. What is your occupation? Where do you come from? What is your country? Of what people are you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, “What have you done?” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Yahweh, because he had told them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us?” For the sea grew more and more stormy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He said to them, “Take me up, and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will be calm for you; for I know that because of me this great storm is on you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not, for the sea grew more and more stormy against them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore they cried to Yahweh, and said, “We beg you, Yahweh, we beg you, don’t let us die for this man’s life, and don’t lay on us innocent blood; for you, Yahweh, have done as it pleased you.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> So they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea ceased its raging.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Then the men feared Yahweh exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh, and made vows. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish’s belly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He said, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“I called because of my affliction to Yahweh. </span> <span class="line">He answered me. </span> <span class="line">Out of the belly of Sheol</span> <span class="line"> I cried. </span> <span class="line">You heard my voice. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">3</span> For you threw me into the depths, </span> <span class="line">in the heart of the seas. </span> <span class="line">The flood was all around me. </span> <span class="line">All your waves and your billows passed over me. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">4</span> I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight; </span> <span class="line">yet I will look again toward your holy temple.’ </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">5</span> The waters surrounded me, </span> <span class="line">even to the soul. </span> <span class="line">The deep was around me. </span> <span class="line">The weeds were wrapped around my head. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">6</span> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. </span> <span class="line">The earth barred me in forever: </span> <span class="line">yet have you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh my God. </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line"><span class="verse">7</span> “When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh. </span> <span class="line">My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">8</span> Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy. </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">9</span> But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving. </span> <span class="line">I will pay that which I have vowed. </span> <span class="line">Salvation belongs to Yahweh.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Then Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s word came to Jonah the second time, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> “Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the message that I give you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to Yahweh’s word. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, three days’ journey across.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried out, and said, “In forty days, Nineveh will be overthrown!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from their greatest even to their least.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The news reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and took off his royal robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He made a proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, “Let neither man nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and animal, and let them cry mightily to God. Yes, let them turn everyone from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Who knows whether God will not turn and relent, and turn away from his fierce anger, so that we might not perish?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way. God relented of the disaster which he said he would do to them, and he didn’t do it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Please, Yahweh, wasn’t this what I said when I was still in my own country? Therefore I hurried to flee to Tarshish, for I knew that you are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and you relent of doing harm.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore now, Yahweh, take, I beg you, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh said, “Is it right for you to be angry?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made himself a booth, and sat under it in the shade, until he might see what would become of the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh God prepared a vine, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the vine.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> But God prepared a worm at dawn the next day, and it chewed on the vine, so that it withered.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> When the sun arose, God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah’s head, so that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the vine?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “I am right to be angry, even to death.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh said, “You have been concerned for the vine, for which you have not labored, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Shouldn’t I be concerned for Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred twenty thousand persons who can’t discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much livestock?” </span> </span>

Someone said, “Rise, and measure God’s temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and don’t measure it, for it has been given to the nations. They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> These are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands, standing before the Lord of the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. If anyone desires to harm them, he must be killed in this way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> These have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy. They have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> From among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations, people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and they will be glad. They will give gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> After the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on those who saw them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here!” They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> In that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The second woe is past.
