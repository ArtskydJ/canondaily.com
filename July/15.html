Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself today to Yahweh?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Then the princes of the fathers’ households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> and they gave for the service of God’s house of gold five thousand talents</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> and ten thousand darics,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of silver ten thousand talents, of bronze eighteen thousand talents, and of iron one hundred thousand talents.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> People with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of Yahweh’s house, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, “You are blessed, Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all! In your hand is power and might! It is in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all!  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you, and we have given you of your own.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> For we are strangers before you, and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now I have seen with joy your people, who are present here, offer willingly to you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless Yahweh your God!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> and ate and drank before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok to be priest. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and gave to him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> He died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries. </span> </span>
