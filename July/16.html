I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you had, and none after you will have.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The king made silver and gold to be as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars to be as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue. The king’s merchants purchased them from Kue.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> They also exported them to the Hittite kings and the Syrian</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> kings. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Solomon decided to build a house for Yahweh’s name, and a house for his kingdom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, “As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, so deal with me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to him, to burn before him incense of sweet spices, for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> “The house which I am building will be great; for our God is greater than all gods.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But who is able to build him a house, since heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him a house, except just to burn incense before him? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “Send me also cedar trees, cypress trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. Behold, my servants will be with your servants,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand cors</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of beaten wheat, twenty thousand baths</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, “Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made you king over them.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Huram continued, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who would build a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, of Huram my father’s,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, in timber, and in purple, in blue, in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any kind of engraving and to devise any device; that there may be a place appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “Now therefore the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you need. We will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa; then you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Solomon counted all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the census with which David his father had counted them; and they found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to assign the people their work. </span> </span>
