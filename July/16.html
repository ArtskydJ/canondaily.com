		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> Solomon the son of David was firmly established in his kingdom, and Yahweh </span> <span class="paragraphtext"> his God</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> was with him, and made him exceedingly great.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ households.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for God’s Tent of Meeting was there, which Yahweh’s servant Moses had made in the wilderness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> But David had brought God’s ark up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Moreover the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was there before Yahweh’s tabernacle; and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the Tent of Meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> That night, God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for what you want me to give you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Solomon said to God, “You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of yours?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, nor yet have you asked for long life; but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> therefore wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you had, and none after you will have.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The king made silver and gold to be as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars to be as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue. The king’s merchants purchased them from Kue.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> They also exported them to the Hittite kings and the Syrian</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> kings. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Solomon decided to build a house for Yahweh’s name, and a house for his kingdom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, “As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, so deal with me.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Behold,</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to him, to burn before him incense of sweet spices, for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> “The house which I am building will be great; for our God is greater than all gods.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But who is able to build him a house, since heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him a house, except just to burn incense before him? </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> “Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> “Send me also cedar trees, cypress trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. Behold, my servants will be with your servants,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand cors</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of beaten wheat, twenty thousand baths</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, “Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made you king over them.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Huram continued, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who would build a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, of Huram my father’s,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, in timber, and in purple, in blue, in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any kind of engraving and to devise any device; that there may be a place appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> “Now therefore the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you need. We will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa; then you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Solomon counted all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the census with which David his father had counted them; and they found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to assign the people their work. </span> </span>
