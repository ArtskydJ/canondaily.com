		<span class="header">2 Chronicles 17-19</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn’t seek the Baals,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not in the ways of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand. All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh. Furthermore, he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> They taught in Judah, having the book of Yahweh’s law with them. They went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams, and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> This was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: From Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Yahweh, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> and next to him Jehozabad, and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready and prepared for war.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> These were those who waited on the king, in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">18</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he allied himself with Ahab.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> After some years, he went down to Ahab to Samaria. Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He answered him, “I am as you are, and my people as your people. We will be with you in the war.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for Yahweh’s word.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">They said, “Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of him?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, “Get Micaiah the son of Imla quickly.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah each sat on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron and said, “Yahweh says, ‘With these you shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> All the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Let your word therefore, please be like one of theirs, and speak good.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, I will say what my God says.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Go up, and prosper. They shall be delivered into your hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The king said to him, “How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in Yahweh’s name?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. Yahweh said, ‘These have no master. Let them each return to his house in peace.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Micaiah said, “Therefore hear Yahweh’s word: I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ One spoke saying in this way, and another saying in that way.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> A spirit came out, stood before Yahweh, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“Yahweh said to him, ‘How?’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> “He said, ‘I will go, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">“He said, ‘You will entice him, and will prevail also. Go and do so.’ </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> “Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did Yahweh’s Spirit go from me to speak to you?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> and say, ‘The king says, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.” ’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Micaiah said, “If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me.” He said, “Listen, you people, all of you!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, “Don’t fight with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel!” Therefore they turned around to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and Yahweh helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, “Turn your hand, and carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> The battle increased that day. However the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening; and at about sunset, he died. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">19</span><span class="verse">1</span> Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked, and love those who hate Yahweh? Because of this, wrath is on you from before Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set your heart to seek God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> and said to the judges, “Consider what you do, for you don’t judge for man, but for Yahweh; and he is with you in the judgment.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now therefore let the fear of Yahweh be on you. Take heed and do it; for there is no iniquity with Yahweh our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites and priests, and of the heads of the fathers’ households of Israel, for the judgment of Yahweh, and for controversies. They returned to Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He commanded them, saying, “You shall do this in the fear of Yahweh, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Whenever any controversy comes to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, you must warn them, that they not be guilty toward Yahweh, and so wrath come on you and on your brothers. Do this, and you will not be guilty.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Yahweh; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king’s matters. Also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and may Yahweh be with the good.” </span> </span>
