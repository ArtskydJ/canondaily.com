		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">35</span><span class="verse">1</span> Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem. They killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them in the service of Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to Yahweh, “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built. It will no longer be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve Yahweh your God, and his people Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Prepare yourselves after your fathers’ houses by your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brothers the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a fathers’ house of the Levites.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Kill the Passover, sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to Yahweh’s word by Moses.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and young goats, all of them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls. These were of the king’s substance.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> His princes gave for a free will offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the rulers of God’s house, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred small livestock, and three hundred head of cattle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small livestock and five hundred head of cattle. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king’s commandment.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> They killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand, and the Levites skinned them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the children of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it is written in the book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance. They boiled the holy offerings in pots, in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night. Therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the gatekeepers were at every gate. They didn’t need to depart from their service, because their brothers the Levites prepared for them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on Yahweh’s altar, according to the commandment of king Josiah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, nor did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, with the priests, the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> This Passover was kept in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you today, but against the house with which I have war. God has commanded me to make haste. Beware that it is God who is with me, that he not destroy you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and didn’t listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, because I am seriously wounded!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Jeremiah lamented for Josiah, and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel. Behold, they are written in the lamentations.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in Yahweh’s law,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">36</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s place in Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The king of Egypt removed him from office at Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of gold.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in Yahweh his God’s sight.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Nebuchadnezzar also carried some of the vessels of Yahweh’s house to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> At the return of the year, king Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the valuable vessels of Yahweh’s house, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He did that which was evil in Yahweh his God’s sight. He didn’t humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from Yahweh’s mouth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted Yahweh’s house which he had made holy in Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until Yahweh’s wrath arose against his people, until there was no remedy. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or gray-headed. He gave them all into his hand.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> All the vessels of God’s house, great and small, and the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> They burned God’s house, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all of its valuable vessels.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon, and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> to fulfill Yahweh’s word by Jeremiah’s mouth, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. As long as it lay desolate, it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that Yahweh’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> “Cyrus king of Persia says, ‘Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given all the kingdoms of the earth to me; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, Yahweh his God be with him, and let him go up.’ ” </span> </span>
