		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">29</span><span class="verse">1</span> Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that David his father had done.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of Yahweh’s house, and repaired them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the wide place on the east,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> and said to them, “Listen to me, you Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify Yahweh, the God of your fathers’ house, and carry the filthiness out of the holy place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> For our fathers were unfaithful, and have done that which was evil in Yahweh our God’s sight, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh, and turned their backs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Therefore Yahweh’s wrath was on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to be tossed back and forth, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as you see with your eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> For, behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> My sons, don’t be negligent now; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him, to minister to him, and that you should be his ministers, and burn incense.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> They gathered their brothers, sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by Yahweh’s words, to cleanse Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The priests went into the inner part of Yahweh’s house to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in Yahweh’s temple into the court of Yahweh’s house. The Levites took it from there to carry it out to the brook Kidron.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they came to Yahweh’s porch. They sanctified Yahweh’s house in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said, “We have cleansed all Yahweh’s house, including the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, and the table of show bread with all its vessels.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Moreover have we prepared and sanctified all the vessels which king Ahaz threw away in his reign, when he was unfaithful. Behold, they are before Yahweh’s altar.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Then Hezekiah the king arose early, gathered the princes of the city, and went up to Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. He commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on Yahweh’s altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar. They killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> They brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands on them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Then the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> He set the Levites in Yahweh’s house with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was from Yahweh by his prophets.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> The Levites stood with David’s instruments, and the priests with the trumpets.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, Yahweh’s song also began, along with the trumpets and David king of Israel’s instruments.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> All the assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. All this continued until the burnt offering was finished. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> When they had finished offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. They sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Then Hezekiah answered, “Now you have consecrated yourselves to Yahweh. Come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into Yahweh’s house.” The assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs. All these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> The consecrated things were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings. Therefore their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of Yahweh’s house was set in order.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced, because of that which God had prepared for the people; for the thing was done suddenly. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">30</span><span class="verse">1</span> Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to Yahweh’s house at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> For the king had taken counsel with his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem to keep the Passover in the second month.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, and the people had not gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem, for they had not kept it in great numbers in the way it is written. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> So the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, “You children of Israel, turn again to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant of you that have escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Don’t be like your fathers and like your brothers, who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as you see.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> Now don’t be stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to Yahweh, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve Yahweh your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> For if you turn again to Yahweh, your brothers and your children will find compassion before those who led them captive, and will come again into this land, because Yahweh your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun, but people ridiculed them and mocked them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Nevertheless some men of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Also the hand of God came on Judah to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by Yahweh’s word. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took away all the altars for incense and threw them into the brook Kidron.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover other than the way it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, “May the good Yahweh pardon everyone  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> who sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers, even if they aren’t clean according to the purification of the sanctuary.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness. The Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day, singing with loud instruments to Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of Yahweh. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to Yahweh, the God of their fathers. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days, and they kept another seven days with gladness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was nothing like this in Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people. Their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven. </span> </span>
