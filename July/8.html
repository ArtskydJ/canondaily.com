Will you deliver them into my hand?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Yahweh said to him, “Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there. David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like waters breaking out. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> They left their gods there; and David gave a command, and they were burned with fire. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The Philistines made a another raid in the valley.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> David inquired again of God; and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them opposite the mulberry trees.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> David did as God commanded him; and they attacked the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">1</span> David made himself houses in David’s city; and he prepared a place for God’s ark, and pitched a tent for it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Then David said, “No one ought to carry God’s ark but the Levites. For Yahweh has chosen them to carry God’s ark, and to minister to him forever.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up Yahweh’s ark to its place, which he had prepared for it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, up to the place that I have prepared for it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> For because you didn’t carry it at first, Yahweh our God broke out in anger against us, because we didn’t seek him according to the ordinance.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The children of the Levites bore God’s ark on their shoulders with its poles, as Moses commanded according to Yahweh’s word.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of music, stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up their voices with joy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> and with them their brothers of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of bronze to sound aloud;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the singing. He taught the singers, because he was skillful.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before God’s ark; and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> When God helped the Levites who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the choir master with the singers; and David had an ephod of linen on him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Thus all Israel brought the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up with shouting, with sound of the cornet, with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> As the ark of Yahweh’s covenant came to David’s city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart. </span> </span>

He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Jesus asked him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“What is your name?”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. Then he allowed them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> The demons came out of the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. Then he entered into the boat and returned.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> “Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him. </span> </span>
