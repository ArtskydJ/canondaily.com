The house of David your servant is established before you.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.” </span> </span>

Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">49</span> While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead.
