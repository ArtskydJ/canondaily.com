For you know your servant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.” </span> </span>

But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians and could not be healed by any  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> came behind him, and touched the fringe</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of his cloak. Immediately the flow of her blood stopped.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> Jesus said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Who touched me?”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">‘Who touched me?’</span> <span class="paragraphtext">” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">46</span> But Jesus said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">47</span> When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">48</span> He said to her, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">49</span> While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">50</span> But Jesus hearing it, answered him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">51</span> When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">52</span> All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">53</span> They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">54</span> But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Child, arise!”</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">55</span> Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">56</span> Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done. </span> </span>
