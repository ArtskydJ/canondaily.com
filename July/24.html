		<span class="header">2 Chronicles 20-21</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> After this, the children of Moab, the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Then some came who told Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea from Syria. Behold, they are in Hazazon Tamar” (that is, En Gedi).  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Jehoshaphat was alarmed, and set himself to seek to Yahweh. He proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Judah gathered themselves together to seek help from Yahweh. They came out of all the cities of Judah to seek Yahweh. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in Yahweh’s house, before the new court;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> and he said, “Yahweh, the God of our fathers, aren’t you God in heaven? Aren’t you ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in your hand, so that no one is able to withstand you.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Didn’t you, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it to the offspring</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of Abraham your friend forever?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> They lived in it, and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name, saying,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> ‘If evil comes on us—the sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this house, and before you (for your name is in this house), and cry to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned away from them, and didn’t destroy them;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> Our God, will you not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that comes against us. We don’t know what to do, but our eyes are on you.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> All Judah stood before Yahweh, with their little ones, their wives, and their children. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Then Yahweh’s Spirit came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, in the middle of the assembly;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> and he said, “Listen, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, king Jehoshaphat. Yahweh says to you, ‘Don’t be afraid, and don’t be dismayed because of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Tomorrow, go down against them. Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> You will not need to fight this battle. Set yourselves, stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh with you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed. Go out against them tomorrow, for Yahweh is with you.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Yahweh, worshiping Yahweh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Yahweh, the God of Israel, with an exceedingly loud voice. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> They rose early in the morning, and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. As they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in Yahweh your God, so you will be established! Believe his prophets, so you will prosper.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to Yahweh, and give praise in holy array, as they go out before the army, and say, “Give thanks to Yahweh; for his loving kindness endures forever.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> When they began to sing and to praise, Yahweh set ambushers against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were struck.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. When they had finished the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy each other. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> When Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness, they looked at the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their plunder, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away. They took plunder for three days, it was so much.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> On the fourth day, they assembled themselves in Beracah</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> Valley, for there they blessed Yahweh. Therefore the name of that place was called “Beracah Valley” to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> They came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments, harps, and trumpets to Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> The fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Yahweh fought against the enemies of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> He walked in the way of Asa his father, and didn’t turn away from it, doing that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> However the high places were not taken away, and the people had still not set their hearts on the God of their fathers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is included in the book of the kings of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> After this, Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. The same did very wickedly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> He joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish. They made the ships in Ezion Geber.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, Yahweh has destroyed your works.” The ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">1</span> Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city, and Jehoram his son reigned in his place.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Their father gave them great gifts of silver, of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Now when Jehoram had risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did Ahab’s house; for he had Ahab’s daughter as his wife. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> However Yahweh would not destroy David’s house, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then Jehoram went there with his captains and all his chariots with him. He rose up by night and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, along with the captains of the chariots.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Yahweh, the God of his fathers. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem play the prostitute, and led Judah astray.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> A letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, “Yahweh, the God of David your father, says, ‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute like Ahab’s house did, and also have slain your brothers of your father’s house, who were better than yourself,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> behold, Yahweh will strike your people with a great plague, including your children, your wives, and all your possessions;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> and you will have great sickness with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> and they came up against Judah, broke into it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, including his sons and his wives; so that there was no son left him, except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> After all this Yahweh struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> In process of time, at the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of severe diseases. His people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He departed without being missed; and they buried him in David’s city, but not in the tombs of the kings. </span> </span>
