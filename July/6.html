		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> The Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> So Saul died with his three sons; and all his house died together.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> They stripped him, and took his head and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to their idols, and to the people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> They put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh, because of Yahweh’s word, which he didn’t keep; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit, to inquire,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> and didn’t inquire of Yahweh. Therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh your God said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to Yahweh’s word by Samuel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (also called Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. The same is David’s city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it David’s city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He built the city all around, from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh of Armies was with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to Yahweh’s word concerning Israel. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> They stood in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> David longed, and said, “Oh that one would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink any of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> and said, “My God forbid me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy?” For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain; however he wasn’t included in the three.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> high. In the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three; and David set him over his guard. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> The mighty men of the armies also include Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">33</span> Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">37</span> Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">46</span> Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">47</span> Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite. </span> </span>
