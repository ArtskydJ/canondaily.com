		<span class="header">2 Chronicles 25-26</span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">25</span><span class="verse">1</span> Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, but not with a perfect heart.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Now when the kingdom was established to him, he killed his servants who had killed his father the king.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> But he didn’t put their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers’ houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin. He counted them from twenty years old and upward, and found that there were three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go out to war, who could handle spear and shield.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of silver.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> A man of God came to him, saying, “O king, don’t let the army of Israel go with you, for Yahweh is not with Israel, with all the children of Ephraim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> But if you will go, take action, and be strong for the battle. God will overthrow you before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to overthrow.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do for the hundred talents</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> which I have given to the army of Israel?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">The man of God answered, “Yahweh is able to give you much more than this.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Then Amaziah separated them, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again. Therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Amaziah took courage, and led his people out, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The children of Judah carried away ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and threw them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much plunder. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Now after Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, “Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> As he talked with him, the king said to him, “Have we made you one of the king’s counselors? Stop! Why should you be struck down?” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">Then the prophet stopped, and said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come! Let’s look one another in the face.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as his wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> You say to yourself that you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast. Now stay at home. Why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> But Amaziah would not listen; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Judah was defeated by Israel; so every man fled to his tent. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in God’s house with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren’t they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> They brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">26</span><span class="verse">1</span> All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God; and as long as he sought Yahweh, God made him prosper. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He went out and fought against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and among the Philistines.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and the Meunim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> The Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah. His name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he grew exceedingly strong.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He built towers in the wilderness, and dug out many cisterns, for he had much livestock; in the lowland also, and in the plain. He had farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields, for he loved farming.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, who went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The whole number of the heads of fathers’ households, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand six hundred.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Under their hand was an army, three hundred seven thousand five hundred, who made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the army, shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> In Jerusalem, he made devices, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spread far abroad, because he was marvelously helped until he was strong. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Yahweh his God; for he went into Yahweh’s temple to burn incense on the altar of incense.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were valiant men.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> They resisted Uzziah the king, and said to him, “It isn’t for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed. It will not be for your honor from Yahweh God.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Then Uzziah was angry. He had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in Yahweh’s house, beside the altar of incense.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from there. Yes, he himself also hurried to go out, because Yahweh had struck him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from Yahweh’s house. Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” Jotham his son reigned in his place. </span> </span>
