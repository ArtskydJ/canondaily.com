		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Solomon began to build Yahweh’s house at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where Yahweh appeared to David his father, which he prepared in the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> He began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God’s house. The length by cubits</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the width twenty cubits.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> The porch that was in front, its length, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He made the larger room with a ceiling of cypress wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He decorated the house with precious stones for beauty. The gold was gold from Parvaim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He also overlaid the house, the beams, the thresholds, its walls, and its doors with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He made the most holy place. Its length, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The weight of the nails was fifty shekels</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of gold. He overlaid the upper rooms with gold. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> In the most holy place he made two cherubim by carving; and they overlaid them with gold.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, joining to the wing of the other cherub.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The wings of these cherubim spread themselves out twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty-five cubits height, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> He made chains in the inner sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> He set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> long, twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Also he made the molten sea</span> <span class="paragraphtext"> of ten cubits from brim to brim. It was round, five cubits high, and thirty cubits in circumference.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Under it was the likeness of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It received and held three thousand baths.</span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He also made ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them. The things that belonged to the burnt offering were washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> He made the ten lamp stands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. He made one hundred basins of gold.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Furthermore he made the court of the priests, the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext">So Huram finished doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God’s house:  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> the two pillars, the bowls, the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> He also made the bases, and he made the basins on the bases;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Huram his father also made the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all its vessels for king Solomon, for Yahweh’s house, of bright bronze.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance; for the weight of the bronze could not be determined. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Solomon made all the vessels that were in God’s house, the golden altar also, and the tables with the show bread on them;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> and the lamp stands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold that was perfect gold;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> and the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans of pure gold. As for the entry of the house, its inner doors for the most holy place and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Thus all the work that Solomon did for Yahweh’s house was finished. Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of God’s house. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh’s covenant out of David’s city, which is Zion.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> So all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> All the elders of Israel came. The Levites took up the ark;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> and they brought up the ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these the Levitical priests brought up.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The priests brought in the ark of Yahweh’s covenant to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark in front of the inner sanctuary; but they were not seen outside; and it is there to this day.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> When the priests had come out of the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and didn’t keep their divisions;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets);  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Yahweh; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, saying, </span> </span> <span class="stanza"> <span class="line">“For he is good; </span> <span class="line">for his loving kindness endures forever!” </span> <span class="line">then the house was filled with a cloud, even Yahweh’s house,  </span> <span class="line"><span class="verse">14</span> so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for Yahweh’s glory filled God’s house. </span> </span>
