These were the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
