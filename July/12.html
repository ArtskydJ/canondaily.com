These were the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> The sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of Yahweh’s house, from twenty years old and upward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> For David said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were counted, from twenty years old and upward.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">28</span> For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of Yahweh’s house, in the courts, and in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of God’s house;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">29</span> for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all measurements of quantity and size;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">30</span> and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">31</span> and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">32</span> and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service of Yahweh’s house. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> Thus they were divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now the first lot came out to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> This was their ordering in their service, to come into Yahweh’s house according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded him. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> Of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> The sons of Hebron: Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> The sons of Uzziel: Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> The brother of Micah: Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.

Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">34</span> While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">35</span> A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">36</span> When the voice came, Jesus was found alone.
