		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">22</span><span class="verse">1</span> The inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, because the band of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the oldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> He also walked in the ways of Ahab’s house, because his mother was his counselor in acting wickedly.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as did Ahab’s house, for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He also followed their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> He returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram; for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to cut off Ahab’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> When Jehu was executing judgment on Ahab’s house, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, serving Ahaziah, and killed them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> He sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and killed him; and they buried him, for they said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all his heart.” The house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> But Jehoshabeath, the king’s daughter, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stealthily rescued him from among the king’s sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she didn’t kill him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> He was with them hidden in God’s house six years while Athaliah reigned over the land. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">23</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the seventh year, Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into a covenant with him.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> They went around in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers’ households of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> All the assembly made a covenant with the king in God’s house. He said to them, “Behold, the king’s son must reign, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> This is the thing that you must do. A third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be gatekeepers of the thresholds.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> A third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation. All the people will be in the courts of Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> But let no one come into Yahweh’s house, except the priests and those who minister of the Levites. They shall come in, for they are holy, but all the people shall follow Yahweh’s instructions.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> The Levites shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand. Whoever comes into the house, let him be slain. Be with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they each took his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest didn’t dismiss the shift.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David’s, which were in God’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> He set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, near the altar and the house, around the king.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Then they brought out the king’s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the covenant, and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and they said, “Long live the king!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> Then she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king. All the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. The singers also played musical instruments, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, “Treason! treason!” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t kill her in Yahweh’s house.”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> So they made way for her. She went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king’s house; and they killed her there. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, all the people, and the king, that they should be Yahweh’s people.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> All the people went to the house of Baal, broke it down, broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> Jehoiada appointed the officers of Yahweh’s house under the hand of the Levitical priests, whom David had distributed in Yahweh’s house, to offer the burnt offerings of Yahweh, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as David had ordered.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> He set the gatekeepers at the gates of Yahweh’s house, that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> He took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from Yahweh’s house. They came through the upper gate to the king’s house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. They had slain Athaliah with the sword. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah, of Beersheba.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">2</span> Joash did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes all the days of Jehoiada the priest.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">3</span> Jehoiada took for him two wives, and he became the father of sons and daughters. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">4</span> After this, Joash intended to restore Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">5</span> He gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather money to repair the house of your God from all Israel from year to year. See that you expedite this matter.” However the Levites didn’t do it right away.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">6</span> The king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, “Why haven’t you required of the Levites to bring in the tax of Moses the servant of Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel, out of Judah and out of Jerusalem, for the Tent of the Testimony?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">7</span> For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up God’s house; and they also gave all the dedicated things of Yahweh’s house to the Baals. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">8</span> So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> They made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> All the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had filled it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Whenever the chest was brought to the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of Yahweh’s house. They hired masons and carpenters to restore Yahweh’s house, and also those who worked iron and bronze to repair Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> So the workmen worked, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands. They set up God’s house as it was designed, and strengthened it.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, from which were made vessels for Yahweh’s house, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, including spoons and vessels of gold and silver. They offered burnt offerings in Yahweh’s house continually all the days of Jehoiada. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died. He was one hundred thirty years old when he died.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> They buried him in David’s city among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Now after the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came, and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">18</span> They abandoned the house of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherah poles and the idols, so wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">19</span> Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to Yahweh, and they testified against them; but they would not listen. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">20</span> The Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to them, “God says, ‘Why do you disobey Yahweh’s commandments, so that you can’t prosper? Because you have forsaken Yahweh, he has also forsaken you.’ ” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">21</span> They conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of Yahweh’s house.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">22</span> Thus Joash the king didn’t remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son. When he died, he said, “May Yahweh look at it, and repay it.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">23</span> At the end of the year, the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all their plunder to the king of Damascus.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">24</span> For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Yahweh delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment on Joash. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">25</span> When they had departed from him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died. They buried him in David’s city, but they didn’t bury him in the tombs of the kings.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">26</span> These are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">27</span> Now concerning his sons, the greatness of the burdens laid on him, and the rebuilding of God’s house, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. Amaziah his son reigned in his place. </span> </span>

		<span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"> <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">37</span> Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">38</span> When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">39</span> The Lord said to him, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">40</span> You foolish ones, didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also? </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">41</span> But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">42</span> But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and God’s love. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">43</span> Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">44</span> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don’t know it.”</span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">45</span> One of the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">46</span> He said, </span> <span class="paragraphtext">“Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won’t even lift one finger to help carry those burdens. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">47</span> Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">48</span> So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">49</span> Therefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute, </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">50</span> that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">51</span> from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation. </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">52</span> Woe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn’t enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.” </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">53</span> As he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him;  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">54</span> lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him. </span> </span>
